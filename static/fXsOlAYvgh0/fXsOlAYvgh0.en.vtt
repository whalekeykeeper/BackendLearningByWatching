00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:06.461
In 1972,

00:00:06.503 --> 00:00:09.881
the US passed a landmark
piece of legislation.

00:00:10.465 --> 00:00:12.801
The new law was called Title IX,

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:17.764
and it expanded economic
and educational opportunities for women,

00:00:17.764 --> 00:00:19.516
especially in higher education.

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:23.728
Back then, there was
a 16-percentage-point gap

00:00:23.728 --> 00:00:25.564
in the awarding of college degrees

00:00:25.564 --> 00:00:26.731
in favor of men.

00:00:26.773 --> 00:00:27.941
Within a decade,

00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:32.612
women had caught up
and then just blew right past the men.

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:38.076
Today, there's an 18-percentage-point gap
in the awarding of college degrees.

00:00:38.868 --> 00:00:42.330
So there's a bigger gender gap today,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.124
in US higher education,

00:00:44.124 --> 00:00:48.211
than there was 50 years ago
when Title IX was passed.

00:00:48.628 --> 00:00:50.463
It's just the other way around.

00:00:52.048 --> 00:00:54.050
I study inequality for a living,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.510
and for most of my career,

00:00:55.552 --> 00:00:58.888
I focused on the divides
of class and race.

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:01.057
But in recent years,

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:04.769
I've just been noticing
more and more gender gaps

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.189
and not in the direction
that I was expecting.

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:10.066
Probably like most of you,

00:01:10.108 --> 00:01:12.402
I’m used to thinking
about gender equality

00:01:12.402 --> 00:01:15.030
and the goal of gender
equality as synonymous

00:01:15.071 --> 00:01:17.157
with the advancement of women and girls.

00:01:17.198 --> 00:01:20.493
But it's now clear
that there are many boys and men

00:01:20.535 --> 00:01:22.162
who've fallen behind

00:01:22.162 --> 00:01:25.790
and that we have to be able to think
about gender inequality

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.334
in both directions.

00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:31.171
One thing that makes that hard
is that the changes have been so quick,

00:01:31.212 --> 00:01:32.339
so rapid,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.176
that it's hard to update our beliefs
to match the new facts.

00:01:36.217 --> 00:01:39.971
It's a bit like the needles
on a compass swinging round.

00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:42.849
Suddenly north is south
and south is north.

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:44.934
It's really quite disorienting.

00:01:46.436 --> 00:01:48.563
But it's clear that on some
measures at least

00:01:48.563 --> 00:01:52.567
now men are lagging quite a way behind,

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.235
not least on college campuses.

00:01:54.277 --> 00:01:57.322
And that reflects the fact
that boys are trailing girls

00:01:57.364 --> 00:01:59.199
throughout the education system.

00:02:00.617 --> 00:02:04.162
Two thirds of the top academic
performers in high school,

00:02:04.204 --> 00:02:06.331
measured by GPA, are girls.

00:02:07.624 --> 00:02:11.211
And two thirds of those
at the bottom are boys.

00:02:12.087 --> 00:02:14.047
It's not just in the US.

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:18.843
If we look at the 20 most economically
advanced countries in the world,

00:02:18.843 --> 00:02:21.596
there's on average
a 13-percentage-point gap

00:02:21.596 --> 00:02:24.641
in the share of young men and young women
with a college degree,

00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:27.769
with young women much more likely
to have a college degree.

00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:30.063
And in some nations,
the gap is much bigger.

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.191
In Norway, for example,

00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:35.610
there's almost a 20-point gap.

00:02:36.945 --> 00:02:38.697
And just like in the US,

00:02:38.697 --> 00:02:40.532
these differences at the college level

00:02:40.532 --> 00:02:43.827
reflect what's happening
earlier in the school system.

00:02:44.744 --> 00:02:48.415
It used to be that maybe boys
were ahead in math and science,

00:02:48.456 --> 00:02:52.502
girls were ahead in reading and language
in roughly equal measure.

00:02:52.502 --> 00:02:53.670
That's not true today.

00:02:53.712 --> 00:02:55.922
Internationally, at the age of 15,

00:02:55.922 --> 00:02:58.758
there's a five-point gap
in favor of boys and math.

00:02:59.092 --> 00:03:01.428
There's essentially no gap in science,

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.139
a slight gap in favor of girls
actually in science.

00:03:04.514 --> 00:03:08.852
But boys are 30 points
behind girls at the age of 15

00:03:08.893 --> 00:03:10.520
in reading and language skills.

00:03:11.938 --> 00:03:15.316
But not all boys and men
are struggling in the same way.

00:03:15.358 --> 00:03:20.071
The intersection of gender with class
and race really matters here.

00:03:20.113 --> 00:03:22.490
So boys from poorer households

00:03:22.532 --> 00:03:24.117
and middle-class households,

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.954
much less likely to attend college
than girls from the same background.

00:03:28.455 --> 00:03:32.000
But there's a much smaller gap
at the top of the economic ladder.

00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:33.793
I think one of the reasons

00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:37.714
that elites can sometimes struggle
to grasp what's going on with boys and men

00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:41.426
is that the gender gaps
are just much less stark

00:03:41.468 --> 00:03:43.136
in affluent communities.

00:03:44.888 --> 00:03:48.725
And the gender gaps are even
more stark for Black Americans.

00:03:49.476 --> 00:03:52.687
For every Black man
getting a college degree,

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:54.481
there are two Black women.

00:03:55.732 --> 00:03:59.819
So anybody who really cares
about boys and men

00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:04.991
has to care about racial injustice
and economic inequality.

00:04:06.242 --> 00:04:10.163
And anybody who really cares
about racial injustice

00:04:10.163 --> 00:04:12.165
and economic inequality

00:04:12.207 --> 00:04:14.125
has to care about boys and men.

00:04:15.502 --> 00:04:19.172
Now, the fact that the education system
doesn't seem to be working very well

00:04:19.214 --> 00:04:20.757
for lots of boys and men

00:04:20.757 --> 00:04:23.009
is obviously not intentional.

00:04:23.676 --> 00:04:29.724
There wasn't a feminist
conspiracy 100 years ago

00:04:29.724 --> 00:04:33.686
to say, "Well, it might take a century,
but eventually we'll overtake them."

00:04:33.728 --> 00:04:35.271
(Laughter)

00:04:35.271 --> 00:04:38.900
Especially as it was men
who mostly designed the school system.

00:04:40.193 --> 00:04:44.864
What’s happened is that
as the artificial and sexist barriers

00:04:44.906 --> 00:04:46.991
that were placed in front
of women and girls

00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:48.827
have been successively removed,

00:04:48.827 --> 00:04:52.622
so their natural advantages
in the classroom have been revealed.

00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:56.084
Compared to girls,

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:59.921
boys face two big structural
disadvantages in education.

00:04:59.963 --> 00:05:03.758
First, their brains simply develop later.

00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:09.722
The skills of planning, organization
and impulse control

00:05:09.764 --> 00:05:12.100
are associated with the prefrontal cortex,

00:05:12.141 --> 00:05:15.603
which develops in adolescence especially.

00:05:15.603 --> 00:05:20.775
But about a year later, on average,
for boys than for girls.

00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:25.989
So there's a significant difference there
in the timing of brain development.

00:05:27.365 --> 00:05:31.035
Social scientists refer to those skills,
planning, organization, etcetera,

00:05:31.077 --> 00:05:33.496
as non-cognitive skills.

00:05:33.997 --> 00:05:36.916
I like to think of them
as "chemistry homework" skills.

00:05:37.834 --> 00:05:41.963
You know, doing your chemistry homework
requires a lot of steps.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.967
You have to be paying attention in class
when the assignment is given.

00:05:45.967 --> 00:05:47.677
You have to make a note of it.

00:05:47.677 --> 00:05:50.805
You have to remember hours later
that you're supposed to do it.

00:05:51.264 --> 00:05:53.766
You have to actually sit down and do it,

00:05:53.808 --> 00:05:56.269
instead of something
more enticing instead.

00:05:56.311 --> 00:05:59.397
And remember, it's chemistry homework,
so that's everything.

00:05:59.397 --> 00:06:00.565
(Laughter)

00:06:00.565 --> 00:06:03.109
Sorry, I know there are some
chemists here, I'm sorry.

00:06:03.151 --> 00:06:04.736
And then turn it in.

00:06:05.737 --> 00:06:07.488
That's a lot of steps, right?

00:06:07.488 --> 00:06:08.656
That's a lot.

00:06:10.074 --> 00:06:14.203
Getting your homework done
requires your impulse control

00:06:14.245 --> 00:06:17.624
to match what psychologists refer to
as sensation seeking.

00:06:17.624 --> 00:06:21.044
Basically, that urge to go and do
something more fun, more exciting.

00:06:21.628 --> 00:06:25.214
And even in the most difficult
years of adolescence,

00:06:25.214 --> 00:06:29.594
which are also the crucial years
for educational success,

00:06:29.636 --> 00:06:35.558
girls have a reasonable balance between
impulse control and sensation seeking.

00:06:36.476 --> 00:06:39.729
But it's a very different story
for adolescent boys.

00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:42.398
They have higher levels
of sensation seeking.

00:06:42.398 --> 00:06:45.652
And with that less developed
prefrontal cortex,

00:06:45.693 --> 00:06:48.947
they have significantly lower levels
of impulse control.

00:06:49.739 --> 00:06:51.157
Again, on average.

00:06:52.283 --> 00:06:55.745
Now if you still don't believe me,

00:06:55.745 --> 00:06:59.624
go into any ninth or 10th grade classroom

00:06:59.666 --> 00:07:02.168
and ask all the students
to open up their backpacks.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:03.378
(Laughter)

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:09.175
Most, many, at least of the girls,
will have pretty carefully organized,

00:07:09.217 --> 00:07:11.010
nicely labeled binders.

00:07:11.052 --> 00:07:12.887
And for many, if not most of the boys,

00:07:12.887 --> 00:07:16.015
it will resemble a small,
controlled explosion.

00:07:16.057 --> 00:07:18.059
(Laughter)

00:07:19.477 --> 00:07:22.647
It's not that girls are smarter than boys.

00:07:23.231 --> 00:07:26.317
There's no gender gap
in intelligence levels

00:07:26.359 --> 00:07:27.944
in either direction.

00:07:28.903 --> 00:07:32.448
It is just that girls develop more
of these non-cognitive skills,

00:07:32.448 --> 00:07:35.284
these "chemistry homework" skills,

00:07:35.284 --> 00:07:37.286
somewhat earlier than boys do.

00:07:38.287 --> 00:07:39.789
That's just a fact.

00:07:40.123 --> 00:07:43.459
But it is a fact that we ignore
in education policy.

00:07:44.335 --> 00:07:47.422
The second big structural problem
that boys face in the classroom

00:07:47.422 --> 00:07:49.048
is the lack of male teachers.

00:07:49.424 --> 00:07:50.717
After falling for decades,

00:07:50.717 --> 00:07:55.221
the share of K-12 teachers who are male
in the US is now just 23 percent.

00:07:56.097 --> 00:07:57.223
And falling.

00:07:57.932 --> 00:08:01.019
And the lack of male teachers matters
for at least three reasons.

00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:04.939
First, for many children, [they]
can be an important male role model,

00:08:04.939 --> 00:08:07.066
especially if they don't have one at home.

00:08:07.483 --> 00:08:11.237
And second, male teachers
appear to be more sensitive

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:13.906
to the specific challenges
of boys in the classroom.

00:08:14.407 --> 00:08:17.744
I can vividly remember my own experience.

00:08:17.744 --> 00:08:23.374
I can actually still feel what it was like
to sit for what felt like hours on end

00:08:23.416 --> 00:08:26.085
on an incredibly hard plastic chair,

00:08:26.127 --> 00:08:29.422
and that it was actually a male
primary school teacher, Mr. Cole,

00:08:29.464 --> 00:08:31.674
who gave us more opportunities
to move around,

00:08:31.674 --> 00:08:34.135
made the lessons a little
bit more interactive.

00:08:35.845 --> 00:08:38.431
And the third reason
male teachers may matter

00:08:38.473 --> 00:08:39.932
is there's some evidence that,

00:08:39.932 --> 00:08:42.518
especially in subjects like English,

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.354
which is where the boys
have fallen so far behind,

00:08:45.396 --> 00:08:48.900
having a male teacher
seems to dispel the idea

00:08:48.941 --> 00:08:52.278
that reading and writing
just aren't for me or for people like me.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.448
In a similar way to how
having a female teacher

00:08:55.448 --> 00:08:58.701
has historically helped girls
in STEM subjects.

00:09:00.036 --> 00:09:03.790
Right now, in too many of our schools,

00:09:03.831 --> 00:09:08.002
our boys feel like square pegs
being forced into round holes.

00:09:09.295 --> 00:09:12.632
And too often our response
is to try and fix the boys

00:09:12.673 --> 00:09:14.300
rather than fix the schools.

00:09:14.801 --> 00:09:19.138
The problems of boys are turned
into problems with boys.

00:09:20.098 --> 00:09:22.517
If they struggle to sit still
or pay attention

00:09:22.558 --> 00:09:24.018
or apply themselves to a task,

00:09:24.018 --> 00:09:27.271
they may be diagnosed
with some kind of disability.

00:09:27.313 --> 00:09:30.983
Their problems are thus medicalized
and often medicated.

00:09:32.068 --> 00:09:35.738
In the US today, 23 percent
of school-age boys

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:39.951
have been diagnosed with some form
of developmental disability.

00:09:39.992 --> 00:09:41.786
Twice the rate for girls.

00:09:41.786 --> 00:09:44.497
ADHD, as you might expect,
is the most common.

00:09:45.123 --> 00:09:47.208
But really,

00:09:47.208 --> 00:09:53.256
when one in four of our boys
has a developmental disability,

00:09:53.256 --> 00:09:57.385
it seems clear to me
that it is the system which is disabling

00:09:57.426 --> 00:09:59.303
rather than the boys who are disabled.

00:09:59.345 --> 00:10:04.934
(Applause)

00:10:04.976 --> 00:10:06.853
Now, there's a lot we can do

00:10:06.894 --> 00:10:09.230
to make the education system
work better for boys.

00:10:09.272 --> 00:10:11.566
Let's start with those two big problems,

00:10:11.607 --> 00:10:14.110
of later brain development
and lack of male teachers.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.822
So first, we should start
boys in school a year later.

00:10:18.698 --> 00:10:21.033
And the idea there
is to level the playing field,

00:10:21.075 --> 00:10:24.036
given those differences
in the timing of brain development.

00:10:24.036 --> 00:10:26.539
And actually that's already
quite common practice

00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:29.792
at private schools and in lots
of affluent communities,

00:10:29.834 --> 00:10:32.128
but it's actually not the boys
from rich families

00:10:32.128 --> 00:10:34.964
who will benefit the most
from that extra year.

00:10:35.006 --> 00:10:36.799
It's the boys from lower-income,

00:10:36.799 --> 00:10:38.634
poorer neighborhoods and families

00:10:38.634 --> 00:10:42.388
who would most benefit from the gift
of extra time for development.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.975
And that's why I think this should be
a question of public policy.

00:10:47.185 --> 00:10:51.981
Second, we need to recruit hundreds
of thousands more male teachers,

00:10:52.023 --> 00:10:54.108
especially in subjects like English,

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.152
where the boys are struggling so much

00:10:56.194 --> 00:10:59.614
and which is the subject
men are least likely to be teaching.

00:11:00.823 --> 00:11:03.492
And here I think we can draw
some really good lessons

00:11:03.534 --> 00:11:04.994
from the successful movement

00:11:05.036 --> 00:11:08.372
to get more women and girls
interested in STEM subjects.

00:11:08.414 --> 00:11:12.835
So that means setting clear targets,
launching public campaigns

00:11:12.835 --> 00:11:15.213
and offering financial scholarships

00:11:15.213 --> 00:11:18.633
to men who want to enter
teaching as a profession.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.719
Of course, those are changes
that will take time.

00:11:21.719 --> 00:11:23.095
Those are long-term changes.

00:11:23.137 --> 00:11:27.183
And there are millions of boys
and men who are struggling right now.

00:11:28.017 --> 00:11:32.230
And so if you're a parent or a teacher
working with a boy or a young man

00:11:32.271 --> 00:11:33.731
who's in difficulty right now,

00:11:33.731 --> 00:11:36.859
my message to you is, first,

00:11:36.901 --> 00:11:41.697
be careful not to even inadvertently
judge him against a female standard

00:11:41.739 --> 00:11:43.783
or blame him if he's
struggling in a system

00:11:43.824 --> 00:11:46.369
that just might not be working
very well for him.

00:11:46.369 --> 00:11:49.121
Recognize and respect the ways
in which he's different.

00:11:50.081 --> 00:11:52.333
Don't say,

00:11:52.375 --> 00:11:54.543
"Why can't you be more like your sister?"

00:11:56.128 --> 00:11:58.089
Try not to even think that.

00:11:59.674 --> 00:12:02.677
It's very important
that we don't treat our boys

00:12:02.677 --> 00:12:04.762
as if they were malfunctioning girls.

00:12:06.305 --> 00:12:10.935
And the second message to those people,
cousins, parents, neighbors, friends,

00:12:10.977 --> 00:12:14.438
uncles, coaches, anybody
working with a boy or a young man

00:12:14.438 --> 00:12:18.192
who is struggling right now,
is simply, thank you.

00:12:18.901 --> 00:12:20.194
Thank you.

00:12:20.236 --> 00:12:21.612
They do need you.

00:12:23.447 --> 00:12:24.657
Of course,

00:12:24.657 --> 00:12:26.325
doing more for boys and men

00:12:26.367 --> 00:12:28.869
doesn't mean doing any less
for women and girls.

00:12:29.662 --> 00:12:32.248
That’s like saying to the parent
of a son and daughter:

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.625
"You're only allowed to care
about one of them."

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:37.586
And it's the kind of zero-sum thinking

00:12:37.586 --> 00:12:41.215
that is doing so much damage
to our politics and to our culture.

00:12:41.257 --> 00:12:43.092
We can think two thoughts at once.

00:12:43.592 --> 00:12:45.845
We can do two things at once.

00:12:45.845 --> 00:12:47.805
(Applause)

00:12:47.805 --> 00:12:49.807
Two thoughts at once, two things at once.

00:12:49.849 --> 00:12:52.018
That's why Norway,

00:12:52.059 --> 00:12:53.936
a country that's made huge investments,

00:12:53.936 --> 00:12:55.563
quite rightly for women and girls,

00:12:55.604 --> 00:12:58.566
but where boys and men have now fallen
behind on many measures,

00:12:58.607 --> 00:13:00.735
has launched a commission
for boys and men.

00:13:01.152 --> 00:13:03.404
I've talked about education today,

00:13:03.446 --> 00:13:06.741
but there are many other areas
where many boys and men are struggling,

00:13:06.741 --> 00:13:09.910
including in mental health,
including suicide risk.

00:13:10.995 --> 00:13:12.872
Loneliness and belonging,

00:13:12.913 --> 00:13:14.749
family life, employment.

00:13:15.583 --> 00:13:18.127
And I don't think we can afford
to get this wrong.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.716
If there are real problems in a society,

00:13:23.758 --> 00:13:28.763
and responsible people
don't acknowledge and address them,

00:13:28.763 --> 00:13:31.766
irresponsible people will exploit them.

00:13:32.308 --> 00:13:34.602
And that is already
happening on this issue,

00:13:34.643 --> 00:13:37.438
both online and at the ballot box.

00:13:37.897 --> 00:13:41.817
We cannot leave a vacuum
by neglecting this issue.

00:13:42.401 --> 00:13:45.821
The future cannot be female.

00:13:46.697 --> 00:13:50.326
Nor, of course, can the future be male.

00:13:50.743 --> 00:13:53.954
The future has to be for every single
one of us, every boy and girl,

00:13:53.954 --> 00:13:55.539
we have to rise together.

00:13:56.123 --> 00:13:57.291
Thank you.

00:13:57.333 --> 00:14:04.340
(Applause)

00:14:06.884 --> 00:14:08.177
(Applause ends)

00:14:08.219 --> 00:14:09.929
Chris Anderson: Thank you, Richard.

00:14:09.929 --> 00:14:11.305
I've got a question for you.

00:14:11.347 --> 00:14:12.598
Come this way.

00:14:13.182 --> 00:14:16.102
So you gave great advice there
for the system as a whole,

00:14:16.143 --> 00:14:18.020
for teachers, for parents.

00:14:18.062 --> 00:14:21.732
But suppose you're a 14-year-old boy
listening to this talk.

00:14:21.732 --> 00:14:23.526
What would you say to him?

00:14:23.859 --> 00:14:25.111
Richard Reeves: Huh.

00:14:25.111 --> 00:14:28.364
Well, the first thing I’d say
is that if you are struggling at school

00:14:28.406 --> 00:14:29.949
or in some aspects of your life,

00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:32.034
that's almost certainly
not just your fault.

00:14:32.034 --> 00:14:34.578
It may be that the system
is just not working for you.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.373
The second thing I would say is ...

00:14:38.374 --> 00:14:39.542
We see you.

00:14:40.084 --> 00:14:41.502
We've got you.

00:14:41.502 --> 00:14:43.921
We understand, we've got your back.

00:14:43.921 --> 00:14:47.299
And the third thing I would say is,
don't follow the people

00:14:47.341 --> 00:14:52.221
who say that the reason you're struggling
is because women are flourishing.

00:14:52.221 --> 00:14:53.389
Or because of feminism.

00:14:53.431 --> 00:14:55.015
Or because of changes in society.

00:14:55.015 --> 00:14:56.475
That we somehow have to,

00:14:56.517 --> 00:14:57.726
in order to lift boys up,

00:14:57.726 --> 00:15:00.354
we have to somehow push women
and girls back down again.

00:15:00.396 --> 00:15:01.856
Don't fall for that.

00:15:01.897 --> 00:15:04.358
Understand that we get
that you're struggling,

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.819
but don't turn this into zero-sum.

00:15:06.819 --> 00:15:10.448
Don't turn to some of the darker corners
of the internet where unfortunately,

00:15:10.489 --> 00:15:12.783
that is the message
many of our boys are getting.

00:15:12.783 --> 00:15:14.785
But the first part
that's really important,

00:15:14.827 --> 00:15:17.329
that whole conversation
that we had about belonging,

00:15:17.329 --> 00:15:19.165
the wonderful difference in belonging,

00:15:19.206 --> 00:15:22.334
if our boys don't feel that they belong,

00:15:22.376 --> 00:15:24.962
that we've got them, that we see them,

00:15:25.004 --> 00:15:27.715
they're going to be much more
vulnerable to those voices.

00:15:27.715 --> 00:15:31.218
So don't listen to those voices,
but we need them to listen to us instead.

00:15:31.218 --> 00:15:32.428
CA: Thank you so much.

00:15:32.428 --> 00:15:34.972
(Applause)
