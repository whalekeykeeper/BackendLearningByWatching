00:07.753 --> 00:12.300
Soft percussion and a toasty scent mark
the violent transformation

00:12.300 --> 00:15.595
of tough seeds into cloud-like puffs.

00:15.928 --> 00:19.724
This is the almost magical process
of popcorn-making.

00:20.390 --> 00:23.977
But how did we actually 
end up with this whimsical food?

00:24.853 --> 00:30.484
All the corn eaten today is derived 
from a tall grass called teosinte,

00:30.609 --> 00:33.820
which Indigenous people 
in what is now southern Mexico

00:33.820 --> 00:37.616
began selectively breeding
about 9,000 years ago.

00:38.241 --> 00:44.539
An ear of teosinte originally yielded 
somewhere between 5 and 12 small kernels,

00:44.539 --> 00:47.502
each with a hard shell called a pericarp.

00:47.877 --> 00:51.464
And some varieties had
a fantastic feature:

00:51.463 --> 00:55.676
if they reached a certain temperature,
their kernels exploded.

00:56.384 --> 00:59.679
Popcorn kernels pop 
because water and starch

00:59.679 --> 01:02.307
are sealed tightly within the pericarp.

01:02.850 --> 01:06.771
When heated, 
the moisture inside becomes steam.

01:06.771 --> 01:10.525
As it expands, it increases 
the internal pressure

01:10.525 --> 01:14.821
and the solid starch transforms
into a gel-like substance.

01:15.112 --> 01:19.742
The pressure finally overcomes
the pericarp’s resistance and it bursts—

01:19.867 --> 01:23.204
the steam and starch expanding 
to form a foam

01:23.203 --> 01:26.206
that quickly cools and dries in the air.

01:26.748 --> 01:31.211
From this small-scale explosion 
also rush forth the compounds

01:31.212 --> 01:34.132
that give popcorn its powerful aroma.

01:34.465 --> 01:38.802
Ancient Indigenous American people
cultivated other maize varieties

01:38.802 --> 01:42.640
with larger, more flavorful kernels
and thinner pericarps.

01:42.807 --> 01:46.811
But the hard-shelled, poppable
variety also persisted

01:47.061 --> 01:49.313
and spread through parts of the Americas.

01:50.022 --> 01:54.152
By the time European colonizers
arrived in the late 1400s,

01:54.152 --> 01:59.323
Indigenous American people were preparing
and eating corn in myriad manners.

01:59.656 --> 02:02.367
Popcorn wasn’t a major
part of their diets.

02:02.534 --> 02:05.203
But it popped up in European accounts,

02:05.203 --> 02:09.375
which described the preparation
of “toasted” or “parched” corn

02:09.375 --> 02:13.086
and its use in some Aztec
feasts and celebrations.

02:13.253 --> 02:15.131
Despite initial reluctance,

02:15.131 --> 02:19.551
colonizers eventually began cultivating—
and popping— corn.

02:20.010 --> 02:23.514
The methods they used at first
were inconsistent and messy.

02:23.681 --> 02:29.061
But with the invention of 
“wire over the fire” baskets around 1837,

02:29.061 --> 02:30.646
the process got easier.

02:30.979 --> 02:33.231
Soon, popcorn picked up steam

02:33.231 --> 02:37.319
and exploded with a reputation
as a low-cost, entertaining snack.

02:37.736 --> 02:39.237
Over the following decades,

02:39.237 --> 02:43.491
it became a mainstay at events and
hundreds of recipes materialized,

02:43.617 --> 02:46.870
mixing popcorn with sweet
and savory ingredients.

02:47.205 --> 02:49.665
But popcorn hadn't yet reached its height.

02:49.998 --> 02:55.879
At the 1893 World’s Fair, an inventor
showcased the first popcorn machine:

02:56.379 --> 03:00.508
a wagon that tossed popcorn
in seasoning as it cooked.

03:00.759 --> 03:06.431
Soon enough, vendors could be seen roving
US city streets with similar machines.

03:06.973 --> 03:11.519
Interestingly, movie theaters
were some of the only American venues

03:11.520 --> 03:14.314
where you wouldn’t find popcorn 
at the time.

03:14.689 --> 03:17.567
Many cinema operators saw 
their establishments

03:17.568 --> 03:21.155
as part of a grand theater tradition
at odds with popcorn—

03:21.197 --> 03:24.408
what they considered a messy,
low-brow street food.

03:24.950 --> 03:28.662
However, when the Great Depression
hit in 1929,

03:28.663 --> 03:31.915
movies provided the public 
with a welcome distraction.

03:32.040 --> 03:36.962
And they had recently gone from being
silent and subtitled to acquiring sound,

03:37.087 --> 03:39.799
making them accessible 
to a wider audience,

03:39.799 --> 03:41.842
including non-literate people.

03:42.259 --> 03:44.552
At about five or ten cents a bag,

03:44.552 --> 03:48.265
popcorn proved an inexpensive luxury
for moviegoers,

03:48.265 --> 03:51.977
so theater operators pounced 
on the money-making opportunity.

03:52.311 --> 03:57.275
Today, a medium bag of popcorn might
cost about 60 cents to make,

03:57.275 --> 04:02.655
but retail for around $6—
a 1,000% markup.

04:03.489 --> 04:08.451
Popcorn sales generate nearly 40%
of all movie theater profits,

04:08.451 --> 04:12.789
helping to offset the high prices
that theaters pay film studios.

04:13.123 --> 04:17.586
Over the last century, people throughout
the Americas continued popping corn,

04:17.586 --> 04:21.632
and different preparations took
hold in markets worldwide.

04:22.300 --> 04:26.262
When microwavable popcorn was launched 
in the 1980s,

04:26.262 --> 04:28.596
popcorn popped off yet again.

04:28.973 --> 04:32.350
Dozens of kinds of popcorn are
now grown in the US.

04:32.475 --> 04:36.605
Different strains assume distinctive
shapes when their kernels explode,

04:36.730 --> 04:40.817
most commonly taking so-called
“mushroom” and “butterfly” forms.

04:41.110 --> 04:44.237
And they’ve been bred 
for supreme poppability.

04:44.529 --> 04:49.075
Over the last century, the amount 
that popcorn expands has doubled:

04:49.285 --> 04:54.832
now, kernels can reach up to 50 times
their original size upon popping.

04:55.081 --> 04:57.877
Not to be corny, 
but popcorn’s come a long way.
