1
00:00:07,753 --> 00:00:12,300
Soft percussion and a toasty scent mark
the violent transformation

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,595
of tough seeds into cloud-like puffs.

3
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:19,724
This is the almost magical process
of popcorn-making.

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,977
But how did we actually 
end up with this whimsical food?

5
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:30,484
All the corn eaten today is derived 
from a tall grass called teosinte,

6
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:33,820
which Indigenous people 
in what is now southern Mexico

7
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,616
began selectively breeding
about 9,000 years ago.

8
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:44,539
An ear of teosinte originally yielded 
somewhere between 5 and 12 small kernels,

9
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:47,502
each with a hard shell called a pericarp.

10
00:00:47,877 --> 00:00:51,464
And some varieties had
a fantastic feature:

11
00:00:51,463 --> 00:00:55,676
if they reached a certain temperature,
their kernels exploded.

12
00:00:56,384 --> 00:00:59,679
Popcorn kernels pop 
because water and starch

13
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,307
are sealed tightly within the pericarp.

14
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,771
When heated, 
the moisture inside becomes steam.

15
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:10,525
As it expands, it increases 
the internal pressure

16
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:14,821
and the solid starch transforms
into a gel-like substance.

17
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:19,742
The pressure finally overcomes
the pericarp’s resistance and it bursts—

18
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:23,204
the steam and starch expanding 
to form a foam

19
00:01:23,203 --> 00:01:26,206
that quickly cools and dries in the air.

20
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:31,211
From this small-scale explosion 
also rush forth the compounds

21
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:34,132
that give popcorn its powerful aroma.

22
00:01:34,465 --> 00:01:38,802
Ancient Indigenous American people
cultivated other maize varieties

23
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:42,640
with larger, more flavorful kernels
and thinner pericarps.

24
00:01:42,807 --> 00:01:46,811
But the hard-shelled, poppable
variety also persisted

25
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:49,313
and spread through parts of the Americas.

26
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:54,152
By the time European colonizers
arrived in the late 1400s,

27
00:01:54,152 --> 00:01:59,323
Indigenous American people were preparing
and eating corn in myriad manners.

28
00:01:59,656 --> 00:02:02,367
Popcorn wasn’t a major
part of their diets.

29
00:02:02,534 --> 00:02:05,203
But it popped up in European accounts,

30
00:02:05,203 --> 00:02:09,375
which described the preparation
of “toasted” or “parched” corn

31
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:13,086
and its use in some Aztec
feasts and celebrations.

32
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:15,131
Despite initial reluctance,

33
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:19,551
colonizers eventually began cultivating—
and popping— corn.

34
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:23,514
The methods they used at first
were inconsistent and messy.

35
00:02:23,681 --> 00:02:29,061
But with the invention of 
“wire over the fire” baskets around 1837,

36
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:30,646
the process got easier.

37
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:33,231
Soon, popcorn picked up steam

38
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:37,319
and exploded with a reputation
as a low-cost, entertaining snack.

39
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:39,237
Over the following decades,

40
00:02:39,237 --> 00:02:43,491
it became a mainstay at events and
hundreds of recipes materialized,

41
00:02:43,617 --> 00:02:46,870
mixing popcorn with sweet
and savory ingredients.

42
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:49,665
But popcorn hadn't yet reached its height.

43
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:55,879
At the 1893 World’s Fair, an inventor
showcased the first popcorn machine:

44
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:00,508
a wagon that tossed popcorn
in seasoning as it cooked.

45
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:06,431
Soon enough, vendors could be seen roving
US city streets with similar machines.

46
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:11,519
Interestingly, movie theaters
were some of the only American venues

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,314
where you wouldn’t find popcorn 
at the time.

48
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:17,567
Many cinema operators saw 
their establishments

49
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:21,155
as part of a grand theater tradition
at odds with popcorn—

50
00:03:21,197 --> 00:03:24,408
what they considered a messy,
low-brow street food.

51
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,662
However, when the Great Depression
hit in 1929,

52
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:31,915
movies provided the public 
with a welcome distraction.

53
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,962
And they had recently gone from being
silent and subtitled to acquiring sound,

54
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:39,799
making them accessible 
to a wider audience,

55
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,842
including non-literate people.

56
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,552
At about five or ten cents a bag,

57
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:48,265
popcorn proved an inexpensive luxury
for moviegoers,

58
00:03:48,265 --> 00:03:51,977
so theater operators pounced 
on the money-making opportunity.

59
00:03:52,311 --> 00:03:57,275
Today, a medium bag of popcorn might
cost about 60 cents to make,

60
00:03:57,275 --> 00:04:02,655
but retail for around $6—
a 1,000% markup.

61
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:08,451
Popcorn sales generate nearly 40%
of all movie theater profits,

62
00:04:08,451 --> 00:04:12,789
helping to offset the high prices
that theaters pay film studios.

63
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:17,586
Over the last century, people throughout
the Americas continued popping corn,

64
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:21,632
and different preparations took
hold in markets worldwide.

65
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:26,262
When microwavable popcorn was launched 
in the 1980s,

66
00:04:26,262 --> 00:04:28,596
popcorn popped off yet again.

67
00:04:28,973 --> 00:04:32,350
Dozens of kinds of popcorn are
now grown in the US.

68
00:04:32,475 --> 00:04:36,605
Different strains assume distinctive
shapes when their kernels explode,

69
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,817
most commonly taking so-called
“mushroom” and “butterfly” forms.

70
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,237
And they’ve been bred 
for supreme poppability.

71
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:49,075
Over the last century, the amount 
that popcorn expands has doubled:

72
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:54,832
now, kernels can reach up to 50 times
their original size upon popping.

73
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:57,877
Not to be corny, 
but popcorn’s come a long way.

74
