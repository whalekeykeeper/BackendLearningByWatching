2
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,782
我这辈子都是个旅行者。<br>I'm a lifelong traveler.

3
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:16,442
即使还是一个小孩子的时候，<br>Even as a little kid,

4
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:18,112
我便了解，事实上，<br>I was actually working out
that it would be cheaper

5
00:00:18,111 --> 00:00:22,047
去读英国寄宿学校会比<br>to go to boarding school in England

6
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:27,167
去加州父母家附近
最好的学校就读还来得便宜。<br>than just to the best school down the road
from my parents' house in California.

7
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:30,547
所以，当我 9 岁时，<br>So, from the time I was nine years old

8
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:33,774
我在一年中，会独自飞行几回，<br>I was flying alone several times a year

9
00:00:33,774 --> 00:00:37,060
穿越北极，就只是去上学。<br>over the North Pole, just to go to school.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,875
当然，飞得越频繁，
我越是爱上旅行，<br>And of course the more I flew
the more I came to love to fly,

11
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:44,149
所以就在我高中毕业后一周，<br>so the very week after I graduated
from high school,

12
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:46,863
我找到一份清理桌子的工作，<br>I got a job mopping tables

13
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:50,554
为了让自己可以在 18 岁那年，<br>so that I could spend
every season of my 18th year

14
00:00:50,554 --> 00:00:54,066
在地球不同的大陆上，
分别待上一季。<br>on a different continent.

15
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:58,187
接着，几乎不可避免地
我成了一个旅游作家，<br>And then, almost inevitably,
I became a travel writer

16
00:00:58,186 --> 00:01:02,295
使我的工作和志趣
可以结合在一块儿。<br>so my job and my joy could become one.

17
00:01:02,636 --> 00:01:06,522
我真的开始发觉
如果你可以幸运地<br>And I really began to feel
that if you were lucky enough

18
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:09,954
漫步于西藏的烛光寺庙，<br>to walk around
the candlelit temples of Tibet

19
00:01:09,953 --> 00:01:12,757
或者在音乐的缭绕间<br>or to wander along the seafronts in Havana

20
00:01:12,757 --> 00:01:15,137
悠然信步于哈瓦那海岸，<br>with music passing all around you,

21
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:18,435
你便能将那声音、天际<br>you could bring those sounds 
and the high cobalt skies

22
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:20,777
与靛蓝海洋的闪烁光芒<br>and the flash of the blue ocean

23
00:01:20,777 --> 00:01:22,790
带给你家乡的朋友，<br>back to your friends at home,

24
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,881
真确地捎来些许神奇，<br>and really bring some magic

25
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:27,402
点亮自身生命。<br>and clarity to your own life.

26
00:01:27,402 --> 00:01:29,867
除了，如你们所知，<br>Except, as you all know,

27
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:32,699
当旅行时，你学到的第一件事情是<br>one of the first things you learn
when you travel

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,076
你必须以正确的视角看世界，
否则大地依然黯淡无光。<br>is that nowhere is magical
unless you can bring the right eyes to it.

29
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:40,557
你带一个易怒的男人爬喜马拉雅山，<br>You take an angry man to the Himalayas,

30
00:01:40,557 --> 00:01:43,513
他只会抱怨那儿的食物。<br>he just starts complaining about the food.

31
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:46,395
我发现，有点怪异的是，<br>And I found that the best way

32
00:01:46,394 --> 00:01:49,298
最好的让自己可以培养<br>that I could develop more attentive
and more appreciative eyes

33
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:52,587
更专注和更珍惜世界的视角的诀窍是<br>was, oddly,

34
00:01:52,587 --> 00:01:55,505
哪儿都不去，静止于原处即可。<br>by going nowhere, just by sitting still.

35
00:01:55,504 --> 00:01:59,003
当然呆在原地正是我们许多人
寻常所得到的东西，<br>And of course sitting still
is how many of us get

36
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:03,614
我们都渴望在快速的生活中获得休息。<br>what we most crave and need
in our accelerated lives, a break.

37
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:06,455
但那却是我唯一的方法，<br>But it was also the only way

38
00:02:06,456 --> 00:02:11,347
让自己可以重历自身的经验幻灯，<br>that I could find to sift through
the slideshow of my experience

39
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:14,631
理解未来与过去。<br>and make sense of the future and the past.

40
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:17,673
如此，我惊异地发现，<br>And so, to my great surprise,

41
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:19,784
我发现无所去处<br>I found that going nowhere

42
00:02:19,784 --> 00:02:23,697
和游览西藏或古巴一样，令人兴奋。<br>was at least as exciting
as going to Tibet or to Cuba.

43
00:02:23,697 --> 00:02:27,222
无所去处，只不过意谓着<br>And by going nowhere,
I mean nothing more intimidating

44
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:30,584
每天花几分钟，<br>than taking a few minutes out of every day

45
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,555
或每季花几天，<br>or a few days out of every season,

46
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:34,524
甚至，如同有些人所做的，<br>or even, as some people do,

47
00:02:34,524 --> 00:02:37,342
在生命中花上几年<br>a few years out of a life

48
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:40,043
长久地静思于某处，<br>in order to sit still long enough

49
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:43,435
寻找感动你最多的一瞬，<br>to find out what moves you most,

50
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:46,778
回忆你最真实的幸福时刻，<br>to recall where your truest happiness lies

51
00:02:46,778 --> 00:02:48,549
同时记住，<br>and to remember that sometimes

52
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:51,264
有时候，谋生与生活<br>making a living and making a life

53
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,447
彼此是处于光谱线上的两端的。<br>point in opposite directions.

54
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:57,653
当然，这是明智的众生历经几百年<br>And of course, this is what wise beings
through the centuries

55
00:02:57,653 --> 00:02:59,896
从每个传统中所告诉我们的。<br>from every tradition have been telling us.

56
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:01,822
这是一个古老的概念。<br>It's an old idea.

57
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:05,117
早在两千多年前，
斯多葛学派提醒我们<br>More than 2,000 years ago, 
the Stoics were reminding us

58
00:03:05,116 --> 00:03:08,170
并不是我们的经验
成就了我们的生命，<br>it's not our experience
that makes our lives,

59
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,668
而是我们用那经验做了什么。<br>it's what we do with it.

60
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,230
想象一下，一阵飓风 
迅速扑向你的城市，<br>Imagine a hurricane suddenly 
sweeps through your town

61
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,438
将所有一切化为废墟。<br>and reduces every last thing to rubble.

62
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,401
某个人身心遭受终身顿挫，<br>One man is traumatized for life.

63
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:26,265
但另一个人，也许甚至是他的兄弟，
却几乎感觉释怀，<br>But another, maybe even his brother,
almost feels liberated,

64
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:30,506
并认定，这是一个可以
使自己重获新生的重要机会。<br>and decides this is a great chance
to start his life anew.

65
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:32,356
这是同样的事件，<br>It's exactly the same event,

66
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:34,908
截然不同的回应。<br>but radically different responses.

67
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:39,489
没有什么是绝对的好坏， 正如莎士比亚
在《哈姆雷特》中所告诉我们的，<br>There is nothing either good or bad,
as Shakespeare told us in "Hamlet,"

68
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,890
好坏由思维决定。<br>but thinking makes it so.

69
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,060
这无疑就是我
作为一个旅者的经验。<br>And this has certainly been
my experience as a traveler.

70
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,233
24 年前，我完成了一次
最不可思议的旅程：<br>Twenty-four years ago I took 
the most mind-bending trip

71
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:51,914
橫跨朝鮮。<br>across North Korea.

72
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:54,804
但这次旅行只持续了几天。<br>But the trip lasted a few days.

73
00:03:54,804 --> 00:03:58,713
这经验对于无所去处的我来说， 
允许我可以在心思中回朔，<br>What I've done with it sitting still,
going back to it in my head,

74
00:03:58,713 --> 00:04:02,056
试着了解它，让它在我的思维中
寻得一个位置，<br>trying to understand it,
finding a place for it in my thinking,

75
00:04:02,056 --> 00:04:04,320
在那儿，它已存留了 24 年，<br>that's lasted 24 years already

76
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,682
而且很可能会在我这生中，
一直持续下去。<br>and will probably last a lifetime.

77
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:11,058
换句话说， 这次旅行，
带给我一些惊人的景致，<br>The trip, in other words,
gave me some amazing sights,

78
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:13,123
但唯有处于静止的状态<br>but it's only sitting still

79
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:16,815
才让我得以将这些风景线
化为更长的见识。<br>that allows me to turn those
into lasting insights.

80
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:19,762
我有时会想，我们的生活<br>And I sometimes think
that so much of our life

81
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:21,778
有太多东西发生在
我们自己的脑袋里，<br>takes place inside our heads,

82
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:26,591
在回忆中，在想象里，
透过诠释，或是猜测，<br>in memory or imagination
or interpretation or speculation,

83
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:29,394
如果我真想改变我的生命，<br>that if I really want to change my life

84
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:33,430
我可能最好从
改变我的思维开始。<br>I might best begin by changing my mind.

85
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,639
同样，这一切都不是新想法；<br>Again, none of this is new;

86
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,569
这就是为什么莎士比亚和斯多葛学派 
在几个世纪前就告诉我们，<br>that's why Shakespeare and the Stoics
were telling us this centuries ago,

87
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:43,502
然而，莎士比亚从未面对过
一天收到两百多封电邮的日子。<br>but Shakespeare never had to face
200 emails in a day.

88
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:44,904
（笑声）<br>(Laughter)

89
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:49,227
据我所知，斯多葛派的学者们
也没待在脸书上。<br>The Stoics, as far as I know,
were not on Facebook.

90
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:52,074
我们都知道，在我们的按需生活中，<br>We all know that in our on-demand lives,

91
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,192
一种最迫切需要之物<br>one of the things that's most on demand

92
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:55,420
就是自己。<br>is ourselves.

93
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,052
无论我们处于何处，处于何时，
无论是夜晚或白天中的任何时刻，<br>Wherever we are, any time of night or day,

94
00:04:58,052 --> 00:05:01,783
我们的老板，垃圾邮件， 
我们的父母都能找到我们。<br>our bosses, junk-mailers,
our parents can get to us.

95
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:05,771
社会学家近年来所发现的是，<br>Sociologists have actually found
that in recent years

96
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:09,230
当今美国人的工作时间
竟然比 50 年前还少，<br>Americans are working fewer hours
than 50 years ago,

97
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,396
但我们却觉得自己的工时更长。<br>but we feel as if we're working more.

98
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,292
我们有越来越多的
可以用来节省时间的设备，<br>We have more and more time-saving devices,

99
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,741
但有时，时间似乎越来越少。<br>but sometimes, it seems,
less and less time.

100
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:20,806
我们比以前更容易与<br>We can more and more easily 
make contact with people

101
00:05:20,805 --> 00:05:23,584
身处地球另一端的人们联系，<br>on the furthest corners of the planet,

102
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:25,579
但有时候，在那过程中，<br>but sometimes in that process

103
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:28,985
我们与自己断了线。<br>we lose contact with ourselves.

104
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:33,117
作为一个旅行者，
让我最为诧异的事情之一就是<br>And one of my biggest surprises 
as a traveler

105
00:05:33,117 --> 00:05:36,295
我发现，时常，往往那些<br>has been to find
that often it's exactly the people

106
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,413
最使我们能够走向世界各地的人<br>who have most enabled us to get anywhere

107
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:42,127
却最希望身居原处。<br>who are intent on going nowhere.

108
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:44,312
换句话说，正是那些<br>In other words, precisely those beings

109
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:46,646
创造了打破旧时的<br>who have created the technologies

110
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:50,196
限制人出游的科技的人们<br>that override so many
of the limits of old,

111
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:53,207
才是最具智慧的个体，
他们理解限制的必须，<br>are the ones wisest
about the need for limits,

112
00:05:53,206 --> 00:05:56,762
甚至在面对科技本身时，亦是如此。<br>even when it comes to technology.

113
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:59,512
有一次我造访谷歌总部，<br>I once went to the Google headquarters

114
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:02,314
我见到了所有你们听说过的事；<br>and I saw all the things
many of you have heard about;

115
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:05,538
室内树屋，蹦床，<br>the indoor tree houses, the trampolines,

116
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:10,016
拥有 20% 属于自己付费工时的员工，<br>workers at that time enjoying 20 percent
of their paid time free

117
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:14,057
允许他们的想象自由漫游。<br>so that they could just let
their imaginations go wandering.

118
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:16,975
但更让我感到印象深刻的是，<br>But what impressed me even more

119
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:20,554
当我正在等待我的数字身份证时，<br>was that as I was waiting
for my digital I.D.,

120
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:23,322
有位谷歌员工告诉我一个项目，<br>one Googler was telling me
about the program

121
00:06:23,322 --> 00:06:27,116
说他正打算教许许多多的谷歌员工<br>that he was about to start
to teach the many, many Googlers

122
00:06:27,117 --> 00:06:30,509
来练习瑜伽，并成为训练师，<br>who practice yoga
to become trainers in it,

123
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:34,764
而另外一个谷歌员工
向我阐述了一本他正想写的书，<br>and the other Googler was telling me
about the book that he was about to write

124
00:06:34,764 --> 00:06:37,778
一本关于内在寻索的书，<br>on the inner search engine,

125
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:40,771
以及科学如何经验性地证明<br>and the ways in which science
has empirically shown

126
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:43,307
打坐，或冥想<br>that sitting still, or meditation,

127
00:06:43,307 --> 00:06:46,920
不仅能促进健康，明晰思维，<br>can lead not just to better 
health or to clearer thinking,

128
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,439
甚至也能增加情绪智慧。<br>but even to emotional intelligence.

129
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,752
我有另一个在硅谷工作的朋友，<br>I have another friend in Silicon Valley

130
00:06:52,752 --> 00:06:55,875
他的确是当前最前沿科技的<br>who is really one 
of the most eloquent spokesmen

131
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,677
最有说服力的代言人，事实上，<br>for the latest technologies,

132
00:06:57,677 --> 00:07:01,562
他是《连线》杂志的
创始人之一，凯文·凯利。<br>and in fact was one of the founders
of Wired magazine, Kevin Kelly.

133
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:05,315
凯文当时正在写一本有关最新技术的书，<br>And Kevin wrote his last book
on fresh technologies

134
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:09,878
但他家里却没有智能手机，
笔记本电脑，或者电视。<br>without a smartphone
or a laptop or a TV in his home.

135
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,761
如同许多住在硅谷的人们，<br>And like many in Silicon Valley,

136
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:15,737
他非常努力地观察<br>he tries really hard to observe

137
00:07:15,737 --> 00:07:18,923
那个称为互联网安息日的东西，<br>what they call an Internet sabbath,

138
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:22,740
在每个星期，有 24 或 48 小时，<br>whereby for 24 or 48 hours every week

139
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,820
他们会彻底地下线，<br>they go completely offline

140
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,969
以寻求一点方向感，<br>in order to gather the sense of direction

141
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:31,622
用来重新调整，并汲取
他们重新上线时之所需。<br>and proportion they'll need 
when they go online again.

142
00:07:31,622 --> 00:07:35,189
有件科技可能尚未给予我们的是<br>The one thing perhaps
that technology hasn't always given us

143
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:39,899
如何可以更聪明地使用科技。<br>is a sense of how to make
the wisest use of technology.

144
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,564
谈到休息日，<br>And when you speak of the sabbath,

145
00:07:42,564 --> 00:07:44,501
让我们看看十戒吧，<br>look at the Ten Commandments --

146
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,873
其中只有一个字的形容词涉及“神圣”，<br>there's only one word there
for which the adjective "holy" is used,

147
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:51,150
而那就是安息日。<br>and that's the Sabbath.

148
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:54,179
我拿起犹太圣典《托拉》，<br>I pick up the Jewish holy book
of the Torah --

149
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,521
它最长的章节，就是关于安息日。<br>its longest chapter, it's on the Sabbath.

150
00:07:57,521 --> 00:08:01,617
我们都知道，这真是
我们所拥有的最大奢侈之一：<br>And we all know that it's really
one of our greatest luxuries,

151
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:03,605
空。<br>the empty space.

152
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:07,528
在许多音乐作品中，停顿或静默<br>In many a piece of music, 
it's the pause or the rest

153
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,638
赋予了这作品美丽形貌。<br>that gives the piece
its beauty and its shape.

154
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:12,570
我知道，作为一个作家，<br>And I know I as a writer

155
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:16,354
我时常会在页面中留下空白，<br>will often try to include
a lot of empty space on the page

156
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:20,065
让读者可以完整地
领会我的思维与句法，<br>so that the reader can complete
my thoughts and sentences

157
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:24,167
以留给想象呼吸的空间。<br>and so that her imagination
has room to breathe.

158
00:08:25,617 --> 00:08:28,195
现在，在实际的领域中，
当然有很多人，<br>Now, in the physical domain, 
of course, many people,

159
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:29,720
倘若他们稍微富余的话，<br>if they have the resources,

160
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,200
会试着在国内拥有第二个家。<br>will try to get a place in the country,
a second home.

161
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,342
我从未有过那些资源，<br>I've never begun to have those resources,

162
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:40,057
但我有时记得
任何时候，若我想的话，<br>but I sometimes remember
that any time I want,

163
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:44,162
我可以给自己放一天假，<br>I can get a second home in time,
if not in space,

164
00:08:44,162 --> 00:08:46,853
来适时地，获得第二个家。<br>just by taking a day off.

165
00:08:46,852 --> 00:08:50,418
当然，这从来就不容易，
每次我这么做，<br>And it's never easy because, of course, 
whenever I do I spend much of it

166
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:52,096
对于所有多出来的<br>worried about all the extra stuff

167
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:54,769
会压垮我隔日工作天的忧虑就会出现。<br>that's going to crash down on me
the following day.

168
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:57,792
有时我会觉得，我宁愿
放弃吃肉，性生活，或红酒，<br>I sometimes think I'd rather give up
meat or sex or wine

169
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,834
也不愿失去任何一丁点查邮箱的机会。<br>than the chance to check on my emails.

170
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:00,957
（笑声）<br>(Laughter)

171
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,265
每一季，我的确给自己三天假期，<br>And every season I do try to take
three days off on retreat

172
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:09,437
但关于丢下我妻子
以及忽略那些<br>but a part of me still feels guilty
to be leaving my poor wife behind

173
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:12,615
老板寄来的看似紧急的邮件，<br>and to be ignoring
all those seemingly urgent emails

174
00:09:12,615 --> 00:09:14,539
以及错过一个朋友的派对，<br>from my bosses

175
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:17,437
我内心某处仍然觉得有负罪感。<br>and maybe to be missing
a friend's birthday party.

176
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:21,264
但一旦来到某个真正安静的地方，<br>But as soon as I get
to a place of real quiet,

177
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:23,734
我才了解，只有去那儿，<br>I realize that it's only by going there

178
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:27,761
我才能拥有全新的，
有创意的，或快意之事<br>that I'll have anything fresh
or creative or joyful to share

179
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,266
和我妻子，上司和朋友分享。<br>with my wife or bosses or friends.

180
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:31,797
否则，老天，<br>Otherwise, really,

181
00:09:31,797 --> 00:09:35,067
我能够加诸于他们的 
仅仅是我的疲惫或分神状态，<br>I'm just foisting on them
my exhaustion or my distractedness,

182
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:37,639
实在无福可言。<br>which is no blessing at all.

183
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:41,317
所以当我 29 岁时，<br>And so when I was 29,

184
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:44,382
我决定要重整自己全部的生活，<br>I decided to remake my entire life

185
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:47,098
为了获得那无所去处的体验。<br>in the light of going nowhere.

186
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:49,600
有天晚上，我从办公室回家，<br>One evening I was coming back
from the office,

187
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,778
当时午夜时分，我正在出租车上，
经过了时代广场，<br>it was after midnight, I was in a taxi
driving through Times Square,

188
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:57,278
我突然惊觉，自己仓皇度日<br>and I suddenly realized
that I was racing around so much

189
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,434
以至于永远无法赶上自己的生活。<br>I could never catch up with my life.

190
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,390
而我当时的生活，事实上<br>And my life then, as it happened,

191
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,072
已差不多就和我小时梦想的一般。<br>was pretty much the one
I might have dreamed of as a little boy.

192
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,387
我有非常有趣的朋友和同事，<br>I had really interesting friends
and colleagues,

193
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:12,634
我在公园大道和第 20 街交口
有个非常棒的公寓。<br>I had a nice apartment
on Park Avenue and 20th Street.

194
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:17,067
我有个对我来说绝佳的工作，
这工作让我得以撰写世界事务，<br>I had, to me, a fascinating job 
writing about world affairs,

195
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:20,056
但我从来未能将自己和它清楚分开，<br>but I could never separate myself
enough from them

196
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:22,049
让自己倾听自己的思绪，<br>to hear myself think --

197
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:25,884
或，去理解是否我真的处于喜乐之中。<br>or really, to understand
if I was truly happy.

198
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:29,072
因此，我放弃我梦想中的工作，<br>And so, I abandoned my dream life

199
00:10:29,072 --> 00:10:33,226
就为了待在一个位于日本京都
某后街里的单间房内，<br>for a single room on the backstreets
of Kyoto, Japan,

200
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:37,667
这地方长久以来产生了一种强烈的<br>which was the place
that had long exerted a strong,

201
00:10:37,668 --> 00:10:41,518
对我来说极为神秘的吸引力。<br>really mysterious gravitational pull on me.

202
00:10:41,518 --> 00:10:43,003
甚至在我孩提时代，<br>Even as a child

203
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:46,224
我会看着一幅京都的画作
并感觉，我认出它来了，<br>I would just look at a painting
of Kyoto and feel I recognized it;

204
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:49,471
在定睛审视它之前，我便知如此。<br>I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it.

205
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,399
但它也是，如同大家所知，<br>But it's also, as you all know,

206
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,119
是一个群山环绕的美丽城市，<br>a beautiful city encircled by hills,

207
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:57,748
充满了 2000 多座寺庙和神社，<br>filled with more than 2,000 temples
and shrines,

208
00:10:57,748 --> 00:11:02,610
人们在那儿静默了 800 年以上之久。<br>where people have been sitting still
for 800 years or more.

209
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,263
就在我搬到那儿不久，<br>And quite soon after I moved there,
I ended up where I still am

210
00:11:05,263 --> 00:11:08,971
我与现在的妻儿，<br>with my wife, formerly our kids,

211
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:12,013
挤在一个有两间房的公寓里，
在一个不毛之地，<br>in a two-room apartment
in the middle of nowhere

212
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:14,401
我们没有自行车，没有车，<br>where we have no bicycle, no car,

213
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,569
没有可以理解的电视节目，<br>no TV I can understand,

214
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,123
我还得以作家和记者的身份，<br>and I still have to support my loved ones

215
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:21,653
抚养我的至亲家人，<br>as a travel writer and a journalist,

216
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:25,018
因此很明显地，这对职业生涯，<br>so clearly this is not ideal
for job advancement

217
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,644
对文化探索，<br>or for cultural excitement

218
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,211
或对体验社会文化纷繁来说，
都不是一个理想的规划。<br>or for social diversion.

219
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:33,659
但我理解，这赋予了我那些<br>But I realized that it gives me
what I prize most,

220
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,039
我最珍爱的日子，<br>which is days

221
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,772
与时刻。<br>and hours.

222
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:40,399
我在那儿从未需要使用手机。<br>I have never once had to use
a cell phone there.

223
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,153
我基本上几乎无须看时间，<br>I almost never have to look at the time,

224
00:11:44,153 --> 00:11:46,497
每天早上我醒来时，<br>and every morning when I wake up,

225
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:48,857
在我眼前展开来的一天<br>really the day stretches in front of me

226
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:51,641
是一片敞开的草地。<br>like an open meadow.

227
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:55,028
当生活向你抛出某个重大惊喜时，<br>And when life throws up
one of its nasty surprises,

228
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:56,989
它不只会出现一次，<br>as it will, more than once,

229
00:11:56,989 --> 00:11:59,170
当一个医生来到我房里，<br>when a doctor comes into my room

230
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:01,064
脸上带着肃穆的表情，<br>wearing a grave expression,

231
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:04,693
或一辆汽车在高速公路上突然改道，
漂移到我车子前方，<br>or a car suddenly veers
in front of mine on the freeway,

232
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:07,437
我知道，在我骨子里，<br>I know, in my bones,

233
00:12:07,437 --> 00:12:10,147
正是那无所去处的时光<br>that it's the time I've spent
going nowhere

234
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,149
帮助我持续保持平静，<br>that is going to sustain me much more

235
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:17,101
那比起我在不丹和复活节岛
所度之日都要有帮助。<br>than all the time I've spent
racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island.

236
00:12:18,306 --> 00:12:19,710
我永远都会是个旅者，<br>I'll always be a traveler --

237
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,614
那是我生活之所系，<br>my livelihood depends on it --

238
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:23,793
然而旅行的美好之处在于，<br>but one of the beauties of travel

239
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:27,899
它让你保有沉静之心，<br>is that it allows you to bring stillness

240
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:32,019
在这莽撞与躁动的世界之中。<br>into the motion and the commotion
of the world.

241
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:35,397
有一次，我在德国的法兰克福搭机，<br>I once got on a plane
in Frankfurt, Germany,

242
00:12:35,397 --> 00:12:38,345
一位年轻的德国女子坐到我身旁，<br>and a young German woman 
came down and sat next to me

243
00:12:38,345 --> 00:12:40,965
与我展开非常友善的对谈，<br>and engaged me
in a very friendly conversation

244
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:42,716
近 30 分钟，<br>for about 30 minutes,

245
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:44,709
接着，她就转过身去，<br>and then she just turned around

246
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,981
静静地坐在那儿 12 有个小时之久。<br>and sat still for 12 hours.

247
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:50,615
她未曾打开屏幕，<br>She didn't once turn on her video monitor,

248
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:53,910
她也没有拿出书本，
甚至从未睡去，<br>she never pulled out a book,
she didn't even go to sleep,

249
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,697
就只是静静地坐着，<br>she just sat still,

250
00:12:56,697 --> 00:13:01,228
她那明晰和沉静已真正传授于我。<br>and something of her clarity and calm
really imparted itself to me.

251
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:06,321
近来我注意到
有越来越多人刻意地<br>I've noticed more and more people
taking conscious measures these days

252
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:09,594
试图在他们的生活中打开一片空间。<br>to try to open up a space
inside their lives.

253
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:11,935
有些人参加黑洞之旅<br>Some people go to black-hole resorts

254
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:14,294
他们会一晚花上几百美元<br>where they'll spend hundreds
of dollars a night

255
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,452
只为了将自己的手机与电脑<br>in order to hand over
their cell phone and their laptop

256
00:13:17,452 --> 00:13:19,656
上缴给度假接待处。<br>to the front desk on arrival.

257
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:21,882
有些我认识的人<br>Some people I know,
just before they go to sleep,

258
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:24,305
并不会在睡前刷屏看信息，<br>instead of scrolling through
their messages

259
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:26,418
或观看 YouTube 视频，<br>or checking out YouTube,

260
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:29,662
反而就只是关灯，听音乐，<br>just turn out the lights
and listen to some music,

261
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:32,187
他们知道，这样会有更好的睡眠，<br>and notice that they sleep much better

262
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:35,301
在隔天一早将更神清气爽。<br>and wake up much refreshed.

263
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:37,507
我曾经有幸地<br>I was once fortunate enough

264
00:13:37,506 --> 00:13:42,546
驾驶于洛杉矶旁的
高耸黯黑的群山之中，<br>to drive into the high, dark mountains
behind Los Angeles,

265
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:45,095
那儿曾经住了伟大的诗人乐手 --<br>where the great poet and singer

266
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:48,317
举世皆知的莱纳德·科恩。<br>and international heartthrob Leonard Cohen

267
00:13:48,317 --> 00:13:52,488
他曾在那儿附近作了好几年的僧人，<br>was living and working for many years
as a full-time monk

268
00:13:52,488 --> 00:13:55,339
就在博帝山禅学中心。<br>in the Mount Baldy Zen Center.

269
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:57,304
当他在 77 岁发表了<br>And I wasn't entirely surprised

270
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:01,014
自己的唱片专辑，<br>when the record that he released
at the age of 77,

271
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:06,294
他故意给这个专辑取了
一个非常不性感的名称 “旧思维”，<br>to which he gave the deliberately 
unsexy title of "Old Ideas,"

272
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:09,258
然而这专辑在全球
17 个国家冲上排行榜首位，<br>went to number one in the charts 
in 17 nations in the world,

273
00:14:09,258 --> 00:14:12,488
在另外 9 个国家冲上前 5 名。<br>hit the top five in nine others.

274
00:14:12,488 --> 00:14:15,255
它触动了我们内心里某种东西，<br>Something in us, I think, is crying out

275
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:19,760
触动了躁动的人们<br>for the sense of intimacy and depth
that we get from people like that.

276
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,543
一种亲密、深刻与沉静的思绪。<br>who take the time
and trouble to sit still.

277
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:27,089
我想许多人拥有这种感觉，我当然也是，<br>And I think many
of us have the sensation,

278
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:31,758
我们站在一个巨大的屏幕前，
距离大约两英寸，<br>I certainly do,<br>that we're standing about two inches away
from a huge screen,

279
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:33,605
人声鼎沸，摩肩接踵，<br>and it's noisy and it's crowded

280
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:35,781
每一刻都在变动着，<br>and it's changing with every second,

281
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,529
而那屏幕即为我们自己的人生。<br>and that screen is our lives.

282
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:42,153
唯有向后退一步，再回头一步，<br>And it's only by stepping back,
and then further back,

283
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:43,891
静静地屏住气，<br>and holding still,

284
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,708
我们才能开始了解那画布上描绘之物，<br>that we can begin to see
what the canvas means

285
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,184
并以更宽广的眼界洞察世界。<br>and to catch the larger picture.

286
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:52,989
有些人已如此做了，他们无须来去。<br>And a few people do that for us
by going nowhere.

287
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,972
因此，在这个快速转变的时代，<br>So, in an age of acceleration,

288
00:14:55,971 --> 00:15:00,020
没有什么比慢下来还要振奋人心。<br>nothing can be more exhilarating
than going slow.

289
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,201
在这个失焦的时代，<br>And in an age of distraction,

290
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,865
没有什么比凝神专注来得奢侈。<br>nothing is so luxurious
as paying attention.

291
00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:09,441
在这个不断变动的时代，<br>And in an age of constant movement,

292
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:13,214
没有什么比静思来得急迫了。<br>nothing is so urgent as sitting still.

293
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:15,443
所以，下一次当你们<br>So you can go on your next vacation

294
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:18,509
去巴黎，夏威夷或新奥尔良度假时，<br>to Paris or Hawaii, or New Orleans;

295
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:22,048
我保证你们会有一段美好时光，<br>I bet you'll have a wonderful time.

296
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:27,116
但如果你们想回家，
期待满怀全新希望，<br>But, if you want to come back home
alive and full of fresh hope,

297
00:15:27,116 --> 00:15:29,276
爱这个世界，<br>in love with the world,

298
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:33,713
我想，也许你们应该试着哪儿都别去。<br>I think you might want
to try considering going nowhere.

299
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:34,860
谢谢各位。<br>Thank you.

300
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,130
（掌声）<br>(Applause)
