00:12.875 --> 00:14.782
I'm a lifelong traveler.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.442
Even as a little kid,

00:16.442 --> 00:19.922
I was actually working out
that it would be cheaper

00:19.922 --> 00:22.048
to go to boarding school in England

00:22.047 --> 00:27.167
than just to the best school down the road
from my parents' house in California.

00:27.167 --> 00:30.547
So, from the time I was nine years old

00:30.547 --> 00:33.774
I was flying alone several times a year

00:33.774 --> 00:37.240
over the North Pole, just to go to school.

00:37.240 --> 00:40.875
And of course the more I flew
the more I came to love to fly,

00:40.884 --> 00:44.149
so the very week after I graduated
from high school,

00:44.149 --> 00:46.863
I got a job mopping tables

00:46.863 --> 00:51.064
so that I could spend
every season of my 18th year

00:51.064 --> 00:54.065
on a different continent.

00:54.066 --> 00:58.187
And then, almost inevitably,
I became a travel writer

00:58.186 --> 01:02.295
so my job and my joy could become one.

01:02.636 --> 01:06.522
And I really began to feel
that if you were lucky enough

01:06.522 --> 01:09.954
to walk around
the candlelit temples of Tibet

01:09.953 --> 01:12.757
or to wander along the seafronts in Havana

01:12.757 --> 01:15.137
with music passing all around you,

01:15.138 --> 01:18.435
you could bring those sounds 
and the high cobalt skies

01:18.435 --> 01:20.777
and the flash of the blue ocean

01:20.777 --> 01:22.790
back to your friends at home,

01:22.790 --> 01:24.581
and really bring some magic

01:24.581 --> 01:27.402
and clarity to your own life.

01:27.402 --> 01:29.867
Except, as you all know,

01:29.867 --> 01:32.699
one of the first things you learn
when you travel

01:32.700 --> 01:38.076
is that nowhere is magical
unless you can bring the right eyes to it.

01:38.078 --> 01:40.557
You take an angry man to the Himalayas,

01:40.557 --> 01:43.873
he just starts complaining about the food.

01:43.873 --> 01:46.395
And I found that the best way

01:46.394 --> 01:50.438
that I could develop more attentive
and more appreciative eyes

01:50.438 --> 01:52.036
was, oddly,

01:52.037 --> 01:55.505
by going nowhere, just by sitting still.

01:55.504 --> 01:58.353
And of course sitting still
is how many of us get

01:58.353 --> 02:03.403
what we most crave and need
in our accelerated lives, a break.

02:04.123 --> 02:05.845
But it was also the only way

02:05.846 --> 02:11.347
that I could find to sift through
the slideshow of my experience

02:11.347 --> 02:14.631
and make sense of the future and the past.

02:14.631 --> 02:17.673
And so, to my great surprise,

02:17.673 --> 02:19.574
I found that going nowhere

02:19.579 --> 02:23.697
was at least as exciting
as going to Tibet or to Cuba.

02:23.697 --> 02:27.748
And by going nowhere,
I mean nothing more intimidating

02:27.752 --> 02:30.584
than taking a few minutes out of every day

02:30.584 --> 02:32.555
or a few days out of every season,

02:32.555 --> 02:34.524
or even, as some people do,

02:34.524 --> 02:37.342
a few years out of a life

02:37.342 --> 02:40.043
in order to sit still long enough

02:40.044 --> 02:43.435
to find out what moves you most,

02:43.435 --> 02:46.778
to recall where your truest happiness lies

02:46.778 --> 02:48.549
and to remember that sometimes

02:48.549 --> 02:51.264
making a living and making a life

02:51.264 --> 02:54.447
point in opposite directions.

02:54.456 --> 02:57.653
And of course, this is what wise beings
through the centuries

02:57.653 --> 02:59.896
from every tradition have been telling us.

02:59.896 --> 03:01.822
It's an old idea.

03:01.823 --> 03:05.117
More than 2,000 years ago, 
the Stoics were reminding us

03:05.116 --> 03:08.170
it's not our experience
that makes our lives,

03:08.170 --> 03:10.378
it's what we do with it.

03:10.378 --> 03:14.230
Imagine a hurricane suddenly 
sweeps through your town

03:14.230 --> 03:18.739
and reduces every last thing to rubble.

03:18.739 --> 03:22.401
One man is traumatized for life.

03:22.401 --> 03:26.265
But another, maybe even his brother,
almost feels liberated,

03:26.264 --> 03:30.506
and decides this is a great chance
to start his life anew.

03:30.507 --> 03:32.356
It's exactly the same event,

03:32.356 --> 03:34.908
but radically different responses.

03:34.908 --> 03:39.289
There is nothing either good or bad,
as Shakespeare told us in "Hamlet,"

03:39.300 --> 03:41.430
but thinking makes it so.

03:42.719 --> 03:46.060
And this has certainly been
my experience as a traveler.

03:46.060 --> 03:49.233
Twenty-four years ago I took 
the most mind-bending trip

03:49.233 --> 03:51.914
across North Korea.

03:51.914 --> 03:54.804
But the trip lasted a few days.

03:54.804 --> 03:58.384
What I've done with it sitting still,
going back to it in my head,

03:58.383 --> 04:02.055
trying to understand it,
finding a place for it in my thinking,

04:02.056 --> 04:04.320
that's lasted 24 years already

04:04.319 --> 04:07.682
and will probably last a lifetime.

04:07.682 --> 04:11.058
The trip, in other words,
gave me some amazing sights,

04:11.058 --> 04:13.123
but it's only sitting still

04:13.123 --> 04:16.815
that allows me to turn those
into lasting insights.

04:16.815 --> 04:19.762
And I sometimes think
that so much of our life

04:19.762 --> 04:21.778
takes place inside our heads,

04:21.778 --> 04:26.591
in memory or imagination
or interpretation or speculation,

04:26.591 --> 04:29.394
that if I really want to change my life

04:29.394 --> 04:33.430
I might best begin by changing my mind.

04:33.430 --> 04:34.949
Again, none of this is new;

04:34.949 --> 04:39.250
that's why Shakespeare and the Stoics
were telling us this centuries ago,

04:39.250 --> 04:43.502
but Shakespeare never had to face
200 emails in a day.

04:43.502 --> 04:44.904
(Laughter)

04:44.904 --> 04:49.227
The Stoics, as far as I know,
were not on Facebook.

04:49.228 --> 04:52.074
We all know that in our on-demand lives,

04:52.084 --> 04:54.192
one of the things that's most on demand

04:54.192 --> 04:55.420
is ourselves.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.052
Wherever we are, any time of night or day,

04:58.052 --> 05:01.783
our bosses, junk-mailers,
our parents can get to us.

05:02.442 --> 05:05.771
Sociologists have actually found
that in recent years

05:05.771 --> 05:09.230
Americans are working fewer hours
than 50 years ago,

05:09.230 --> 05:12.396
but we feel as if we're working more.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.942
We have more and more time-saving devices,

05:14.942 --> 05:18.742
but sometimes, it seems,
less and less time.

05:18.742 --> 05:21.225
We can more and more easily 
make contact with people

05:21.225 --> 05:23.584
on the furthest corners of the planet,

05:23.584 --> 05:25.579
but sometimes in that process

05:25.579 --> 05:29.324
we lose contact with ourselves.

05:29.324 --> 05:33.117
And one of my biggest surprises 
as a traveler

05:33.117 --> 05:36.295
has been to find
that often it's exactly the people

05:36.295 --> 05:39.413
who have most enabled us to get anywhere

05:39.413 --> 05:42.127
who are intent on going nowhere.

05:42.127 --> 05:44.312
In other words, precisely those beings

05:44.312 --> 05:46.646
who have created the technologies

05:46.646 --> 05:50.196
that override so many
of the limits of old,

05:50.196 --> 05:53.207
are the ones wisest
about the need for limits,

05:53.206 --> 05:56.882
even when it comes to technology.

05:56.882 --> 05:59.512
I once went to the Google headquarters

05:59.512 --> 06:02.314
and I saw all the things
many of you have heard about;

06:02.314 --> 06:05.538
the indoor tree houses, the trampolines,

06:05.538 --> 06:10.016
workers at that time enjoying 20 percent
of their paid time free

06:10.016 --> 06:14.057
so that they could just let
their imaginations go wandering.

06:14.057 --> 06:16.975
But what impressed me even more

06:16.975 --> 06:20.554
was that as I was waiting
for my digital I.D.,

06:20.553 --> 06:23.322
one Googler was telling me
about the program

06:23.322 --> 06:27.116
that he was about to start
to teach the many, many Googlers

06:27.117 --> 06:30.509
who practice yoga
to become trainers in it,

06:30.509 --> 06:34.764
and the other Googler was telling me
about the book that he was about to write

06:34.764 --> 06:37.778
on the inner search engine,

06:37.778 --> 06:40.771
and the ways in which science
has empirically shown

06:40.771 --> 06:43.307
that sitting still, or meditation,

06:43.307 --> 06:46.920
can lead not just to better 
health or to clearer thinking,

06:46.920 --> 06:50.439
but even to emotional intelligence.

06:50.439 --> 06:52.752
I have another friend in Silicon Valley

06:52.752 --> 06:55.875
who is really one 
of the most eloquent spokesmen

06:55.875 --> 06:57.677
for the latest technologies,

06:57.677 --> 07:01.562
and in fact was one of the founders
of Wired magazine, Kevin Kelly.

07:01.562 --> 07:05.315
And Kevin wrote his last book
on fresh technologies

07:05.315 --> 07:09.878
without a smartphone
or a laptop or a TV in his home.

07:09.879 --> 07:12.761
And like many in Silicon Valley,

07:12.761 --> 07:15.737
he tries really hard to observe

07:15.737 --> 07:18.923
what they call an Internet sabbath,

07:19.642 --> 07:22.740
whereby for 24 or 48 hours every week

07:22.740 --> 07:25.820
they go completely offline

07:25.821 --> 07:27.969
in order to gather the sense of direction

07:27.968 --> 07:31.463
and proportion they'll need 
when they go online again.

07:31.463 --> 07:35.189
The one thing perhaps
that technology hasn't always given us

07:35.189 --> 07:39.899
is a sense of how to make
the wisest use of technology.

07:39.899 --> 07:42.564
And when you speak of the sabbath,

07:42.564 --> 07:44.501
look at the Ten Commandments --

07:44.500 --> 07:48.873
there's only one word there
for which the adjective "holy" is used,

07:48.874 --> 07:51.150
and that's the Sabbath.

07:51.149 --> 07:54.179
I pick up the Jewish holy book
of the Torah --

07:54.180 --> 07:57.521
its longest chapter, it's on the Sabbath.

07:57.521 --> 08:01.418
And we all know that it's really
one of our greatest luxuries,

08:01.418 --> 08:03.605
the empty space.

08:03.605 --> 08:07.528
In many a piece of music, 
it's the pause or the rest

08:07.528 --> 08:10.638
that gives the piece
its beauty and its shape.

08:10.637 --> 08:12.221
And I know I as a writer

08:12.221 --> 08:16.353
will often try to include
a lot of empty space on the page

08:16.353 --> 08:20.065
so that the reader can complete
my thoughts and sentences

08:20.065 --> 08:24.167
and so that her imagination
has room to breathe.

08:25.617 --> 08:28.195
Now, in the physical domain, 
of course, many people,

08:28.196 --> 08:29.720
if they have the resources,

08:29.720 --> 08:33.200
will try to get a place in the country,
a second home.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.342
I've never begun to have those resources,

08:36.341 --> 08:40.057
but I sometimes remember
that any time I want,

08:40.057 --> 08:44.422
I can get a second home in time,
if not in space,

08:44.422 --> 08:46.853
just by taking a day off.

08:46.852 --> 08:50.418
And it's never easy because, of course, 
whenever I do I spend much of it

08:50.418 --> 08:52.096
worried about all the extra stuff

08:52.096 --> 08:54.769
that's going to crash down on me
the following day.

08:54.769 --> 08:57.792
I sometimes think I'd rather give up
meat or sex or wine

08:57.792 --> 08:59.834
than the chance to check on my emails.

08:59.833 --> 09:00.957
(Laughter)

09:00.957 --> 09:05.265
And every season I do try to take
three days off on retreat

09:05.265 --> 09:09.567
but a part of me still feels guilty
to be leaving my poor wife behind

09:09.567 --> 09:12.615
and to be ignoring
all those seemingly urgent emails

09:12.615 --> 09:14.370
from my bosses

09:14.370 --> 09:17.437
and maybe to be missing
a friend's birthday party.

09:17.437 --> 09:21.264
But as soon as I get
to a place of real quiet,

09:21.264 --> 09:23.734
I realize that it's only by going there

09:23.734 --> 09:27.761
that I'll have anything fresh
or creative or joyful to share

09:27.760 --> 09:30.266
with my wife or bosses or friends.

09:30.267 --> 09:31.547
Otherwise, really,

09:31.547 --> 09:35.067
I'm just foisting on them
my exhaustion or my distractedness,

09:35.067 --> 09:37.639
which is no blessing at all.

09:38.849 --> 09:41.317
And so when I was 29,

09:41.317 --> 09:44.382
I decided to remake my entire life

09:44.381 --> 09:47.098
in the light of going nowhere.

09:47.099 --> 09:49.600
One evening I was coming back
from the office,

09:49.600 --> 09:53.778
it was after midnight, I was in a taxi
driving through Times Square,

09:53.778 --> 09:57.278
and I suddenly realized
that I was racing around so much

09:57.278 --> 10:00.434
I could never catch up with my life.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.250
And my life then, as it happened,

10:02.250 --> 10:06.072
was pretty much the one
I might have dreamed of as a little boy.

10:06.072 --> 10:08.387
I had really interesting friends
and colleagues,

10:08.386 --> 10:12.634
I had a nice apartment
on Park Avenue and 20th Street.

10:12.634 --> 10:17.067
I had, to me, a fascinating job 
writing about world affairs,

10:17.067 --> 10:20.056
but I could never separate myself
enough from them

10:20.056 --> 10:21.759
to hear myself think --

10:21.759 --> 10:25.884
or really, to understand
if I was truly happy.

10:25.884 --> 10:29.072
And so, I abandoned my dream life

10:29.072 --> 10:33.226
for a single room on the backstreets
of Kyoto, Japan,

10:34.381 --> 10:37.667
which was the place
that had long exerted a strong,

10:37.668 --> 10:41.518
really mysterious gravitational pull on me.

10:41.518 --> 10:42.853
Even as a child

10:42.852 --> 10:46.223
I would just look at a painting
of Kyoto and feel I recognized it;

10:46.224 --> 10:49.471
I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it.

10:49.471 --> 10:51.399
But it's also, as you all know,

10:51.399 --> 10:54.119
a beautiful city encircled by hills,

10:54.119 --> 10:57.748
filled with more than 2,000 temples
and shrines,

10:57.748 --> 11:02.860
where people have been sitting still
for 800 years or more.

11:02.860 --> 11:06.853
And quite soon after I moved there,
I ended up where I still am

11:06.852 --> 11:09.431
with my wife, formerly our kids,

11:09.432 --> 11:12.013
in a two-room apartment
in the middle of nowhere

11:12.013 --> 11:14.401
where we have no bicycle, no car,

11:14.400 --> 11:16.569
no TV I can understand,

11:16.570 --> 11:19.123
and I still have to support my loved ones

11:19.123 --> 11:21.653
as a travel writer and a journalist,

11:21.653 --> 11:25.018
so clearly this is not ideal
for job advancement

11:25.018 --> 11:26.845
or for cultural excitement

11:26.845 --> 11:29.211
or for social diversion.

11:29.211 --> 11:33.740
But I realized that it gives me
what I prize most,

11:34.399 --> 11:36.039
which is days

11:36.039 --> 11:37.772
and hours.

11:37.773 --> 11:40.399
I have never once had to use
a cell phone there.

11:40.399 --> 11:43.942
I almost never have to look at the time,

11:43.942 --> 11:46.496
and every morning when I wake up,

11:46.496 --> 11:48.857
really the day stretches in front of me

11:48.857 --> 11:51.831
like an open meadow.

11:51.831 --> 11:55.028
And when life throws up
one of its nasty surprises,

11:55.028 --> 11:56.989
as it will, more than once,

11:56.989 --> 11:59.170
when a doctor comes into my room

11:59.169 --> 12:01.064
wearing a grave expression,

12:01.065 --> 12:04.693
or a car suddenly veers
in front of mine on the freeway,

12:04.692 --> 12:07.437
I know, in my bones,

12:07.437 --> 12:10.147
that it's the time I've spent
going nowhere

12:10.147 --> 12:12.149
that is going to sustain me much more

12:12.149 --> 12:17.101
than all the time I've spent
racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island.

12:18.306 --> 12:19.710
I'll always be a traveler --

12:19.710 --> 12:21.614
my livelihood depends on it --

12:21.614 --> 12:23.793
but one of the beauties of travel

12:23.793 --> 12:27.899
is that it allows you to bring stillness

12:27.899 --> 12:32.019
into the motion and the commotion
of the world.

12:32.019 --> 12:35.397
I once got on a plane
in Frankfurt, Germany,

12:35.397 --> 12:38.345
and a young German woman 
came down and sat next to me

12:38.345 --> 12:40.965
and engaged me
in a very friendly conversation

12:40.965 --> 12:42.716
for about 30 minutes,

12:42.716 --> 12:44.709
and then she just turned around

12:44.708 --> 12:47.981
and sat still for 12 hours.

12:47.981 --> 12:50.615
She didn't once turn on her video monitor,

12:50.615 --> 12:53.910
she never pulled out a book,
she didn't even go to sleep,

12:53.910 --> 12:56.697
she just sat still,

12:56.697 --> 13:01.228
and something of her clarity and calm
really imparted itself to me.

13:01.999 --> 13:06.321
I've noticed more and more people
taking conscious measures these days

13:06.321 --> 13:09.594
to try to open up a space
inside their lives.

13:09.605 --> 13:11.935
Some people go to black-hole resorts

13:11.934 --> 13:14.294
where they'll spend hundreds
of dollars a night

13:14.294 --> 13:17.452
in order to hand over
their cell phone and their laptop

13:17.452 --> 13:19.656
to the front desk on arrival.

13:19.657 --> 13:22.622
Some people I know,
just before they go to sleep,

13:22.621 --> 13:24.745
instead of scrolling through
their messages

13:24.745 --> 13:26.418
or checking out YouTube,

13:26.418 --> 13:29.662
just turn out the lights
and listen to some music,

13:29.662 --> 13:32.088
and notice that they sleep much better

13:32.087 --> 13:35.300
and wake up much refreshed.

13:35.301 --> 13:37.507
I was once fortunate enough

13:37.506 --> 13:42.546
to drive into the high, dark mountains
behind Los Angeles,

13:42.547 --> 13:45.095
where the great poet and singer

13:45.095 --> 13:48.317
and international heartthrob Leonard Cohen

13:48.317 --> 13:52.488
was living and working for many years
as a full-time monk

13:52.488 --> 13:55.339
in the Mount Baldy Zen Center.

13:55.339 --> 13:57.304
And I wasn't entirely surprised

13:57.303 --> 14:01.014
when the record that he released
at the age of 77,

14:01.014 --> 14:06.294
to which he gave the deliberately 
unsexy title of "Old Ideas,"

14:06.296 --> 14:09.258
went to number one in the charts 
in 17 nations in the world,

14:09.258 --> 14:12.488
hit the top five in nine others.

14:12.488 --> 14:15.255
Something in us, I think, is crying out

14:15.254 --> 14:19.760
for the sense of intimacy and depth
that we get from people like that.

14:19.760 --> 14:23.543
who take the time
and trouble to sit still.

14:23.543 --> 14:25.781
And I think many
of us have the sensation,

14:25.780 --> 14:27.308
I certainly do,

14:27.308 --> 14:31.757
that we're standing about two inches away
from a huge screen,

14:31.767 --> 14:33.605
and it's noisy and it's crowded

14:33.605 --> 14:35.781
and it's changing with every second,

14:35.780 --> 14:38.529
and that screen is our lives.

14:38.529 --> 14:42.153
And it's only by stepping back,
and then further back,

14:42.153 --> 14:43.891
and holding still,

14:43.890 --> 14:46.708
that we can begin to see
what the canvas means

14:46.708 --> 14:49.004
and to catch the larger picture.

14:49.004 --> 14:52.990
And a few people do that for us
by going nowhere.

14:53.950 --> 14:55.972
So, in an age of acceleration,

14:55.971 --> 15:00.020
nothing can be more exhilarating
than going slow.

15:00.020 --> 15:02.201
And in an age of distraction,

15:02.201 --> 15:05.865
nothing is so luxurious
as paying attention.

15:06.715 --> 15:09.441
And in an age of constant movement,

15:09.441 --> 15:13.214
nothing is so urgent as sitting still.

15:13.214 --> 15:15.443
So you can go on your next vacation

15:15.442 --> 15:18.509
to Paris or Hawaii, or New Orleans;

15:18.509 --> 15:22.048
I bet you'll have a wonderful time.

15:22.048 --> 15:27.116
But, if you want to come back home
alive and full of fresh hope,

15:27.116 --> 15:29.276
in love with the world,

15:29.277 --> 15:33.713
I think you might want
to try considering going nowhere.

15:33.712 --> 15:34.860
Thank you.

15:34.860 --> 15:36.130
(Applause)
