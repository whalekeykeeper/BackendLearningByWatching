1
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,782
I'm a lifelong traveler.

2
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:16,442
Even as a little kid,

3
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:19,922
I was actually working out
that it would be cheaper

4
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:22,048
to go to boarding school in England

5
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:27,167
than just to the best school down the road
from my parents' house in California.

6
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:30,547
So, from the time I was nine years old

7
00:00:30,547 --> 00:00:33,774
I was flying alone several times a year

8
00:00:33,774 --> 00:00:37,240
over the North Pole, just to go to school.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,875
And of course the more I flew
the more I came to love to fly,

10
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:44,149
so the very week after I graduated
from high school,

11
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:46,863
I got a job mopping tables

12
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:51,064
so that I could spend
every season of my 18th year

13
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:54,065
on a different continent.

14
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:58,187
And then, almost inevitably,
I became a travel writer

15
00:00:58,186 --> 00:01:02,295
so my job and my joy could become one.

16
00:01:02,636 --> 00:01:06,522
And I really began to feel
that if you were lucky enough

17
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:09,954
to walk around
the candlelit temples of Tibet

18
00:01:09,953 --> 00:01:12,757
or to wander along the seafronts in Havana

19
00:01:12,757 --> 00:01:15,137
with music passing all around you,

20
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:18,435
you could bring those sounds 
and the high cobalt skies

21
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:20,777
and the flash of the blue ocean

22
00:01:20,777 --> 00:01:22,790
back to your friends at home,

23
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,581
and really bring some magic

24
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:27,402
and clarity to your own life.

25
00:01:27,402 --> 00:01:29,867
Except, as you all know,

26
00:01:29,867 --> 00:01:32,699
one of the first things you learn
when you travel

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,076
is that nowhere is magical
unless you can bring the right eyes to it.

28
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:40,557
You take an angry man to the Himalayas,

29
00:01:40,557 --> 00:01:43,873
he just starts complaining about the food.

30
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:46,395
And I found that the best way

31
00:01:46,394 --> 00:01:50,438
that I could develop more attentive
and more appreciative eyes

32
00:01:50,438 --> 00:01:52,036
was, oddly,

33
00:01:52,037 --> 00:01:55,505
by going nowhere, just by sitting still.

34
00:01:55,504 --> 00:01:58,353
And of course sitting still
is how many of us get

35
00:01:58,353 --> 00:02:03,403
what we most crave and need
in our accelerated lives, a break.

36
00:02:04,123 --> 00:02:05,845
But it was also the only way

37
00:02:05,846 --> 00:02:11,347
that I could find to sift through
the slideshow of my experience

38
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:14,631
and make sense of the future and the past.

39
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:17,673
And so, to my great surprise,

40
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:19,574
I found that going nowhere

41
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:23,697
was at least as exciting
as going to Tibet or to Cuba.

42
00:02:23,697 --> 00:02:27,748
And by going nowhere,
I mean nothing more intimidating

43
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:30,584
than taking a few minutes out of every day

44
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,555
or a few days out of every season,

45
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:34,524
or even, as some people do,

46
00:02:34,524 --> 00:02:37,342
a few years out of a life

47
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:40,043
in order to sit still long enough

48
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:43,435
to find out what moves you most,

49
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:46,778
to recall where your truest happiness lies

50
00:02:46,778 --> 00:02:48,549
and to remember that sometimes

51
00:02:48,549 --> 00:02:51,264
making a living and making a life

52
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,447
point in opposite directions.

53
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:57,653
And of course, this is what wise beings
through the centuries

54
00:02:57,653 --> 00:02:59,896
from every tradition have been telling us.

55
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:01,822
It's an old idea.

56
00:03:01,823 --> 00:03:05,117
More than 2,000 years ago, 
the Stoics were reminding us

57
00:03:05,116 --> 00:03:08,170
it's not our experience
that makes our lives,

58
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,378
it's what we do with it.

59
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:14,230
Imagine a hurricane suddenly 
sweeps through your town

60
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,739
and reduces every last thing to rubble.

61
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,401
One man is traumatized for life.

62
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:26,265
But another, maybe even his brother,
almost feels liberated,

63
00:03:26,264 --> 00:03:30,506
and decides this is a great chance
to start his life anew.

64
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:32,356
It's exactly the same event,

65
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:34,908
but radically different responses.

66
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:39,289
There is nothing either good or bad,
as Shakespeare told us in "Hamlet,"

67
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,430
but thinking makes it so.

68
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,060
And this has certainly been
my experience as a traveler.

69
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,233
Twenty-four years ago I took 
the most mind-bending trip

70
00:03:49,233 --> 00:03:51,914
across North Korea.

71
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:54,804
But the trip lasted a few days.

72
00:03:54,804 --> 00:03:58,384
What I've done with it sitting still,
going back to it in my head,

73
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:02,055
trying to understand it,
finding a place for it in my thinking,

74
00:04:02,056 --> 00:04:04,320
that's lasted 24 years already

75
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,682
and will probably last a lifetime.

76
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:11,058
The trip, in other words,
gave me some amazing sights,

77
00:04:11,058 --> 00:04:13,123
but it's only sitting still

78
00:04:13,123 --> 00:04:16,815
that allows me to turn those
into lasting insights.

79
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:19,762
And I sometimes think
that so much of our life

80
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:21,778
takes place inside our heads,

81
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:26,591
in memory or imagination
or interpretation or speculation,

82
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:29,394
that if I really want to change my life

83
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:33,430
I might best begin by changing my mind.

84
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,949
Again, none of this is new;

85
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:39,250
that's why Shakespeare and the Stoics
were telling us this centuries ago,

86
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,502
but Shakespeare never had to face
200 emails in a day.

87
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:44,904
(Laughter)

88
00:04:44,904 --> 00:04:49,227
The Stoics, as far as I know,
were not on Facebook.

89
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:52,074
We all know that in our on-demand lives,

90
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,192
one of the things that's most on demand

91
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:55,420
is ourselves.

92
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,052
Wherever we are, any time of night or day,

93
00:04:58,052 --> 00:05:01,783
our bosses, junk-mailers,
our parents can get to us.

94
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:05,771
Sociologists have actually found
that in recent years

95
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:09,230
Americans are working fewer hours
than 50 years ago,

96
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,396
but we feel as if we're working more.

97
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,942
We have more and more time-saving devices,

98
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:18,742
but sometimes, it seems,
less and less time.

99
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:21,225
We can more and more easily 
make contact with people

100
00:05:21,225 --> 00:05:23,584
on the furthest corners of the planet,

101
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:25,579
but sometimes in that process

102
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:29,324
we lose contact with ourselves.

103
00:05:29,324 --> 00:05:33,117
And one of my biggest surprises 
as a traveler

104
00:05:33,117 --> 00:05:36,295
has been to find
that often it's exactly the people

105
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,413
who have most enabled us to get anywhere

106
00:05:39,413 --> 00:05:42,127
who are intent on going nowhere.

107
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:44,312
In other words, precisely those beings

108
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:46,646
who have created the technologies

109
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:50,196
that override so many
of the limits of old,

110
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:53,207
are the ones wisest
about the need for limits,

111
00:05:53,206 --> 00:05:56,882
even when it comes to technology.

112
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:59,512
I once went to the Google headquarters

113
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:02,314
and I saw all the things
many of you have heard about;

114
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:05,538
the indoor tree houses, the trampolines,

115
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:10,016
workers at that time enjoying 20 percent
of their paid time free

116
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:14,057
so that they could just let
their imaginations go wandering.

117
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:16,975
But what impressed me even more

118
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:20,554
was that as I was waiting
for my digital I.D.,

119
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:23,322
one Googler was telling me
about the program

120
00:06:23,322 --> 00:06:27,116
that he was about to start
to teach the many, many Googlers

121
00:06:27,117 --> 00:06:30,509
who practice yoga
to become trainers in it,

122
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:34,764
and the other Googler was telling me
about the book that he was about to write

123
00:06:34,764 --> 00:06:37,778
on the inner search engine,

124
00:06:37,778 --> 00:06:40,771
and the ways in which science
has empirically shown

125
00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:43,307
that sitting still, or meditation,

126
00:06:43,307 --> 00:06:46,920
can lead not just to better 
health or to clearer thinking,

127
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,439
but even to emotional intelligence.

128
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,752
I have another friend in Silicon Valley

129
00:06:52,752 --> 00:06:55,875
who is really one 
of the most eloquent spokesmen

130
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,677
for the latest technologies,

131
00:06:57,677 --> 00:07:01,562
and in fact was one of the founders
of Wired magazine, Kevin Kelly.

132
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:05,315
And Kevin wrote his last book
on fresh technologies

133
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:09,878
without a smartphone
or a laptop or a TV in his home.

134
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,761
And like many in Silicon Valley,

135
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:15,737
he tries really hard to observe

136
00:07:15,737 --> 00:07:18,923
what they call an Internet sabbath,

137
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:22,740
whereby for 24 or 48 hours every week

138
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,820
they go completely offline

139
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,969
in order to gather the sense of direction

140
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:31,463
and proportion they'll need 
when they go online again.

141
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:35,189
The one thing perhaps
that technology hasn't always given us

142
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:39,899
is a sense of how to make
the wisest use of technology.

143
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,564
And when you speak of the sabbath,

144
00:07:42,564 --> 00:07:44,501
look at the Ten Commandments --

145
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,873
there's only one word there
for which the adjective "holy" is used,

146
00:07:48,874 --> 00:07:51,150
and that's the Sabbath.

147
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:54,179
I pick up the Jewish holy book
of the Torah --

148
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,521
its longest chapter, it's on the Sabbath.

149
00:07:57,521 --> 00:08:01,418
And we all know that it's really
one of our greatest luxuries,

150
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:03,605
the empty space.

151
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:07,528
In many a piece of music, 
it's the pause or the rest

152
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:10,638
that gives the piece
its beauty and its shape.

153
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:12,221
And I know I as a writer

154
00:08:12,221 --> 00:08:16,353
will often try to include
a lot of empty space on the page

155
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:20,065
so that the reader can complete
my thoughts and sentences

156
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:24,167
and so that her imagination
has room to breathe.

157
00:08:25,617 --> 00:08:28,195
Now, in the physical domain, 
of course, many people,

158
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:29,720
if they have the resources,

159
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,200
will try to get a place in the country,
a second home.

160
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,342
I've never begun to have those resources,

161
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:40,057
but I sometimes remember
that any time I want,

162
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:44,422
I can get a second home in time,
if not in space,

163
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:46,853
just by taking a day off.

164
00:08:46,852 --> 00:08:50,418
And it's never easy because, of course, 
whenever I do I spend much of it

165
00:08:50,418 --> 00:08:52,096
worried about all the extra stuff

166
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:54,769
that's going to crash down on me
the following day.

167
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:57,792
I sometimes think I'd rather give up
meat or sex or wine

168
00:08:57,792 --> 00:08:59,834
than the chance to check on my emails.

169
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:00,957
(Laughter)

170
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,265
And every season I do try to take
three days off on retreat

171
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:09,567
but a part of me still feels guilty
to be leaving my poor wife behind

172
00:09:09,567 --> 00:09:12,615
and to be ignoring
all those seemingly urgent emails

173
00:09:12,615 --> 00:09:14,370
from my bosses

174
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,437
and maybe to be missing
a friend's birthday party.

175
00:09:17,437 --> 00:09:21,264
But as soon as I get
to a place of real quiet,

176
00:09:21,264 --> 00:09:23,734
I realize that it's only by going there

177
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:27,761
that I'll have anything fresh
or creative or joyful to share

178
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,266
with my wife or bosses or friends.

179
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:31,547
Otherwise, really,

180
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:35,067
I'm just foisting on them
my exhaustion or my distractedness,

181
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:37,639
which is no blessing at all.

182
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:41,317
And so when I was 29,

183
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:44,382
I decided to remake my entire life

184
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:47,098
in the light of going nowhere.

185
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:49,600
One evening I was coming back
from the office,

186
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,778
it was after midnight, I was in a taxi
driving through Times Square,

187
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:57,278
and I suddenly realized
that I was racing around so much

188
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,434
I could never catch up with my life.

189
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,250
And my life then, as it happened,

190
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,072
was pretty much the one
I might have dreamed of as a little boy.

191
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,387
I had really interesting friends
and colleagues,

192
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:12,634
I had a nice apartment
on Park Avenue and 20th Street.

193
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:17,067
I had, to me, a fascinating job 
writing about world affairs,

194
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:20,056
but I could never separate myself
enough from them

195
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:21,759
to hear myself think --

196
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,884
or really, to understand
if I was truly happy.

197
00:10:25,884 --> 00:10:29,072
And so, I abandoned my dream life

198
00:10:29,072 --> 00:10:33,226
for a single room on the backstreets
of Kyoto, Japan,

199
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:37,667
which was the place
that had long exerted a strong,

200
00:10:37,668 --> 00:10:41,518
really mysterious gravitational pull on me.

201
00:10:41,518 --> 00:10:42,853
Even as a child

202
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:46,223
I would just look at a painting
of Kyoto and feel I recognized it;

203
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:49,471
I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it.

204
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,399
But it's also, as you all know,

205
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,119
a beautiful city encircled by hills,

206
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:57,748
filled with more than 2,000 temples
and shrines,

207
00:10:57,748 --> 00:11:02,860
where people have been sitting still
for 800 years or more.

208
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,853
And quite soon after I moved there,
I ended up where I still am

209
00:11:06,852 --> 00:11:09,431
with my wife, formerly our kids,

210
00:11:09,432 --> 00:11:12,013
in a two-room apartment
in the middle of nowhere

211
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:14,401
where we have no bicycle, no car,

212
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,569
no TV I can understand,

213
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,123
and I still have to support my loved ones

214
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:21,653
as a travel writer and a journalist,

215
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:25,018
so clearly this is not ideal
for job advancement

216
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,845
or for cultural excitement

217
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:29,211
or for social diversion.

218
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:33,740
But I realized that it gives me
what I prize most,

219
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,039
which is days

220
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,772
and hours.

221
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:40,399
I have never once had to use
a cell phone there.

222
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,942
I almost never have to look at the time,

223
00:11:43,942 --> 00:11:46,496
and every morning when I wake up,

224
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:48,857
really the day stretches in front of me

225
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:51,831
like an open meadow.

226
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:55,028
And when life throws up
one of its nasty surprises,

227
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:56,989
as it will, more than once,

228
00:11:56,989 --> 00:11:59,170
when a doctor comes into my room

229
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:01,064
wearing a grave expression,

230
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:04,693
or a car suddenly veers
in front of mine on the freeway,

231
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:07,437
I know, in my bones,

232
00:12:07,437 --> 00:12:10,147
that it's the time I've spent
going nowhere

233
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:12,149
that is going to sustain me much more

234
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:17,101
than all the time I've spent
racing around to Bhutan or Easter Island.

235
00:12:18,306 --> 00:12:19,710
I'll always be a traveler --

236
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,614
my livelihood depends on it --

237
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:23,793
but one of the beauties of travel

238
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:27,899
is that it allows you to bring stillness

239
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:32,019
into the motion and the commotion
of the world.

240
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:35,397
I once got on a plane
in Frankfurt, Germany,

241
00:12:35,397 --> 00:12:38,345
and a young German woman 
came down and sat next to me

242
00:12:38,345 --> 00:12:40,965
and engaged me
in a very friendly conversation

243
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:42,716
for about 30 minutes,

244
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:44,709
and then she just turned around

245
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,981
and sat still for 12 hours.

246
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:50,615
She didn't once turn on her video monitor,

247
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:53,910
she never pulled out a book,
she didn't even go to sleep,

248
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,697
she just sat still,

249
00:12:56,697 --> 00:13:01,228
and something of her clarity and calm
really imparted itself to me.

250
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:06,321
I've noticed more and more people
taking conscious measures these days

251
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:09,594
to try to open up a space
inside their lives.

252
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:11,935
Some people go to black-hole resorts

253
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:14,294
where they'll spend hundreds
of dollars a night

254
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,452
in order to hand over
their cell phone and their laptop

255
00:13:17,452 --> 00:13:19,656
to the front desk on arrival.

256
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:22,622
Some people I know,
just before they go to sleep,

257
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:24,745
instead of scrolling through
their messages

258
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:26,418
or checking out YouTube,

259
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:29,662
just turn out the lights
and listen to some music,

260
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:32,088
and notice that they sleep much better

261
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:35,300
and wake up much refreshed.

262
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:37,507
I was once fortunate enough

263
00:13:37,506 --> 00:13:42,546
to drive into the high, dark mountains
behind Los Angeles,

264
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:45,095
where the great poet and singer

265
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:48,317
and international heartthrob Leonard Cohen

266
00:13:48,317 --> 00:13:52,488
was living and working for many years
as a full-time monk

267
00:13:52,488 --> 00:13:55,339
in the Mount Baldy Zen Center.

268
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:57,304
And I wasn't entirely surprised

269
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:01,014
when the record that he released
at the age of 77,

270
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:06,294
to which he gave the deliberately 
unsexy title of "Old Ideas,"

271
00:14:06,296 --> 00:14:09,258
went to number one in the charts 
in 17 nations in the world,

272
00:14:09,258 --> 00:14:12,488
hit the top five in nine others.

273
00:14:12,488 --> 00:14:15,255
Something in us, I think, is crying out

274
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:19,760
for the sense of intimacy and depth
that we get from people like that.

275
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,543
who take the time
and trouble to sit still.

276
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:25,781
And I think many
of us have the sensation,

277
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,308
I certainly do,

278
00:14:27,308 --> 00:14:31,757
that we're standing about two inches away
from a huge screen,

279
00:14:31,767 --> 00:14:33,605
and it's noisy and it's crowded

280
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:35,781
and it's changing with every second,

281
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,529
and that screen is our lives.

282
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:42,153
And it's only by stepping back,
and then further back,

283
00:14:42,153 --> 00:14:43,891
and holding still,

284
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,708
that we can begin to see
what the canvas means

285
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,004
and to catch the larger picture.

286
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:52,990
And a few people do that for us
by going nowhere.

287
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,972
So, in an age of acceleration,

288
00:14:55,971 --> 00:15:00,020
nothing can be more exhilarating
than going slow.

289
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,201
And in an age of distraction,

290
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,865
nothing is so luxurious
as paying attention.

291
00:15:06,715 --> 00:15:09,441
And in an age of constant movement,

292
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:13,214
nothing is so urgent as sitting still.

293
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:15,443
So you can go on your next vacation

294
00:15:15,442 --> 00:15:18,509
to Paris or Hawaii, or New Orleans;

295
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:22,048
I bet you'll have a wonderful time.

296
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:27,116
But, if you want to come back home
alive and full of fresh hope,

297
00:15:27,116 --> 00:15:29,276
in love with the world,

298
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:33,713
I think you might want
to try considering going nowhere.

299
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:34,860
Thank you.

300
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,130
(Applause)
