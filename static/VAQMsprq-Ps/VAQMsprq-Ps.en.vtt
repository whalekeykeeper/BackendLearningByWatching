00:00:04.376 --> 00:00:08.797
I joined the British Royal Navy
at the tender age of 17

00:00:08.838 --> 00:00:13.760
and in three decades of service,
lived in worked in every ocean.

00:00:14.636 --> 00:00:18.348
I witnessed firsthand
the hidden world of the high seas,

00:00:18.348 --> 00:00:22.060
sometimes the only vessel
for hundreds of miles.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.313
And other times I'd wake up
surrounded in a fishing fleet

00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:28.984
that, despite having powerful
technology at my fingertips,

00:00:28.984 --> 00:00:31.987
I didn’t really know who they were
or what they’d been doing.

00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:36.157
It is a Wild West out there,
and rogue fishers ...

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:40.203
rogue fishes are extracting --

00:00:40.203 --> 00:00:43.582
well, they’re disobeying the laws
that we put in place

00:00:43.623 --> 00:00:46.042
to protect our ocean and its resources.

00:00:46.084 --> 00:00:51.047
And they're pillaging
colossal amounts of fish.

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:52.549
Seafood,

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:56.928
one fifth of seafood is thought to be
caught illegally or is simply unreported.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.182
And that's a crime worth
up to 23.5 billion dollars.

00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:04.644
And it's a crime that skews the science,

00:01:04.686 --> 00:01:07.981
so it affects the sustainability
of our fisheries,

00:01:08.023 --> 00:01:10.150
it threatens the health of our ocean

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.111
and the well-being of millions of people,

00:01:13.153 --> 00:01:15.655
mainly in poorer countries.

00:01:17.198 --> 00:01:19.576
And it's not just pirate fishing

00:01:19.618 --> 00:01:21.828
that's threatening
the future of our ocean.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.456
Out at sea, oil spills
are going undetected

00:01:24.497 --> 00:01:25.832
and therefore unpunished.

00:01:25.874 --> 00:01:28.835
There’s a massive, unmonitored
growth in shipping,

00:01:28.877 --> 00:01:32.714
oil and gas exploration and aquaculture,
to mention just a few.

00:01:32.756 --> 00:01:38.011
And this is piling pressure on an ocean
that's already stressed by climate change.

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.265
The straightforward fact is,

00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:44.434
if you can't see it, you can't manage it.

00:01:44.476 --> 00:01:47.854
And I know from experience,
you can't monitor the whole ocean

00:01:47.896 --> 00:01:49.481
from the decks of ships.

00:01:49.898 --> 00:01:51.483
But you can from space.

00:01:51.483 --> 00:01:52.984
And these are interesting times

00:01:53.026 --> 00:01:56.696
because seemingly intractable problems
are starting to yield

00:01:56.696 --> 00:02:01.201
to the power of technology, AI,
and global interconnectedness.

00:02:01.826 --> 00:02:04.621
Up there right now,
there's thousands of satellites,

00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:09.209
beaming back an enormous amount of data
from the remotest parts of our ocean.

00:02:09.876 --> 00:02:12.587
What if we could harness that data,

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.008
make it useful and available to people
who care about the ocean?

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.888
Well, thanks to rapid advances in
technology and AI, we can do that.

00:02:22.722 --> 00:02:26.309
Using GPS location data
and machine learning,

00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:29.771
Global Fishing Watch built
the first-ever live stream map

00:02:29.771 --> 00:02:33.358
to monitor the industrial fishing fleet.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.194
At the moment, we see some 70,000 vessels.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.573
We've made this information public
and freely available to the world.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.243
But technology moves on.

00:02:43.284 --> 00:02:44.411
Thank you.

00:02:44.452 --> 00:02:47.747
(Applause)

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:49.332
Technology moves on rapidly.

00:02:49.332 --> 00:02:52.127
There's new and emerging technology
that we need to embrace

00:02:52.127 --> 00:02:54.754
in order to give this picture
to everybody who needs it.

00:02:54.796 --> 00:02:58.049
Like when we were working with our
partners in Japan and South Korea,

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.428
they told us there was illegal fishing
suspected in North Korean waters

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.471
in contravention
of the UN sanctions there.

00:03:03.471 --> 00:03:05.473
But when we first took a look on our map,

00:03:05.473 --> 00:03:07.016
we could see very little fishing

00:03:07.058 --> 00:03:10.103
because those vessels were not sharing
their GPS location data,

00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:11.312
as they should.

00:03:11.312 --> 00:03:13.064
We call them “dark vessels.”

00:03:13.064 --> 00:03:15.775
And generally, dark vessels
are up to no good.

00:03:15.817 --> 00:03:18.027
So we had to turn
to other sources of data.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.157
We looked at satellite-based
radar and optical imagery,

00:03:22.198 --> 00:03:23.450
and we lit that region up.

00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:26.828
We revealed an armada
of almost 1,000 vessels.

00:03:27.245 --> 00:03:30.081
It's one of the largest cases
of illegal fishing ever seen.

00:03:31.374 --> 00:03:34.419
But there's huge human impact too.

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:35.795
Tragedy.

00:03:35.795 --> 00:03:37.422
Because they're smaller,

00:03:37.464 --> 00:03:40.800
more rickety North Korean boats
could not compete with that vast fleet.

00:03:40.842 --> 00:03:43.928
They were pushed further and further
out to sea, and as a result,

00:03:43.928 --> 00:03:48.558
hundreds of them would be capsized
to be washed ashore in Japan

00:03:48.558 --> 00:03:51.019
with the crew either starving or dead.

00:03:52.312 --> 00:03:56.149
We made our findings public
and as a result,

00:03:56.191 --> 00:03:58.860
we compelled the authorities
to take action.

00:03:58.902 --> 00:04:01.738
Illegal fishing in that region
has dropped by 75 percent,

00:04:01.738 --> 00:04:05.283
and we're not seeing hundreds of vessels
now washing ashore in Japan.

00:04:05.325 --> 00:04:09.913
(Applause)

00:04:10.705 --> 00:04:14.876
The good news is
that the techniques we used

00:04:14.918 --> 00:04:17.212
to illuminate what
was happening in North Korea,

00:04:17.212 --> 00:04:19.589
we can use anywhere and everywhere

00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:21.800
to make the invisible visible.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.802
Today, any of you can click
on the internet

00:04:23.843 --> 00:04:27.764
to explore roads and buildings on land.

00:04:27.806 --> 00:04:30.558
Why can't we do the same for the ocean?

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.728
We need to create a dynamic, complete map

00:04:33.728 --> 00:04:35.980
of all industrial activity out at sea

00:04:36.022 --> 00:04:39.067
and make it available
to everybody for free.

00:04:39.734 --> 00:04:42.862
Well, thanks to the Audacious community,

00:04:42.862 --> 00:04:47.450
we're going to do that using
GPS location data

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.703
and millions of gigabytes
of satellite imagery,

00:04:50.745 --> 00:04:55.458
we’ll use AI to map and monitor
more than a million oceangoing vessels.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.920
We will monitor the entire
industrial fishing fleet

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.922
and those dark vessels.

00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:04.217
We'll add in hundreds
of thousands of cargo vessels,

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.095
tens of thousands of oil
and gas structures,

00:05:07.095 --> 00:05:10.014
aquaculture farms and wind farms.

00:05:10.014 --> 00:05:12.225
With this public information,

00:05:12.267 --> 00:05:14.894
conservationists will have
the information they need

00:05:14.936 --> 00:05:16.688
to protect critical habitats.

00:05:16.688 --> 00:05:19.816
Like National Geographic Pristine Seas.

00:05:19.816 --> 00:05:23.027
They're using our data to help
work with governments and communities

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:26.865
to protect critical habitats
in seven marine parks

00:05:26.906 --> 00:05:30.994
with a combined area of more
than twice that of California.

00:05:32.328 --> 00:05:34.873
And we're going to give researchers
the data they need

00:05:34.873 --> 00:05:36.124
to advance ocean science.

00:05:36.124 --> 00:05:39.294
And we’re going to give
the media, campaigners

00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:43.381
and the public powerful knowledge
about human activity out at sea.

00:05:43.423 --> 00:05:45.174
And this comes just in time

00:05:45.216 --> 00:05:48.845
because after two decades of talking,

00:05:48.845 --> 00:05:53.725
we finally have a treaty to manage
the conservation of ocean life

00:05:53.766 --> 00:05:58.104
and the establishment of marine protected
areas out on our ocean.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.026
(Applause)

00:06:03.026 --> 00:06:05.820
And this is going to be critical because

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.742
almost 200 countries have committed
to protecting 30 percent of the ocean

00:06:10.783 --> 00:06:12.118
by 2030.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.788
And they will need tools like this
to uphold that promise.

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:20.835
We can develop the tools
that governments need

00:06:20.835 --> 00:06:23.338
to uphold their commitments.

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:26.966
We can inspire a new wave
of ocean management

00:06:27.008 --> 00:06:29.427
through public data

00:06:29.427 --> 00:06:30.970
and open technology.

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:34.182
Now, I might have salt in my veins,

00:06:34.223 --> 00:06:36.476
but you don't need
to have sailed the seven seas

00:06:36.517 --> 00:06:38.353
to care about the future of the ocean.

00:06:38.353 --> 00:06:40.104
All life on Earth depends on it.

00:06:40.563 --> 00:06:43.232
It's providing the oxygen we breathe,

00:06:43.232 --> 00:06:45.401
it’s regulating our climate,

00:06:45.401 --> 00:06:49.447
and it's providing the food
that billions of people rely on.

00:06:49.822 --> 00:06:53.076
But ocean resources are not inexhaustible,
we’ve got to protect them.

00:06:53.076 --> 00:06:55.620
We have the chance
to do that today like never before.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.875
We can give a free, open-access
monitoring system for the entire ocean.

00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:05.213
Together we can reign in
this outlaw ocean.

00:07:06.673 --> 00:07:08.800
We can end pirate fishing.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.553
And we can transform ocean management
for the common good of all.

00:07:12.595 --> 00:07:13.763
Thank you.

00:07:13.763 --> 00:07:16.182
(Applause)
