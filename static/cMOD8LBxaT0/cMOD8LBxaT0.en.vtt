00:00:04.334 --> 00:00:07.504
About eight years ago,
I met a young woman.

00:00:07.546 --> 00:00:09.089
I'll call her Sophia.

00:00:09.506 --> 00:00:11.883
And she showed me her newborn in her lap.

00:00:11.883 --> 00:00:14.803
And she said to me, "This wasn't my plan."

00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:17.973
She described how her unplanned pregnancy

00:00:17.973 --> 00:00:20.642
forced her to drop out
of community college,

00:00:20.684 --> 00:00:22.602
how she then lost her job

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:24.771
and was now living
with her mother in Texas.

00:00:25.897 --> 00:00:28.316
Sophia had already had
two unplanned children

00:00:28.316 --> 00:00:30.402
before this third child was born.

00:00:31.278 --> 00:00:34.614
All three of Sofia's pregnancies occurred
while she was on the pill.

00:00:35.365 --> 00:00:38.201
It was a birth control method
that just didn't work for her,

00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:40.620
but it was the only method
she'd ever been offered.

00:00:41.663 --> 00:00:43.748
Sophia's pregnancies
weren't just unplanned.

00:00:43.748 --> 00:00:46.167
She actively planned
not to become pregnant

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:48.378
and took precautions against it.

00:00:48.378 --> 00:00:51.214
But the only method
she was ever offered failed her.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.341
In the US each year,

00:00:53.383 --> 00:00:56.720
nearly half of all pregnancies
are unplanned.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.514
I know it's an astonishing number
to get your head around.

00:01:00.223 --> 00:01:01.933
And over the span of ten years,

00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:06.062
it's been estimated that six out of ten
typical birth-control pill users

00:01:06.062 --> 00:01:08.273
will become accidentally pregnant.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.610
This is not just about uninformed teens.

00:01:11.943 --> 00:01:15.071
Most unplanned pregnancies occur
to women who are in their 20s.

00:01:15.363 --> 00:01:18.783
In fact, about half of all
unplanned pregnancies occur to women

00:01:18.825 --> 00:01:21.536
who are actually using
birth control, like Sophia.

00:01:21.536 --> 00:01:23.913
Most people know about pills and condoms.

00:01:23.913 --> 00:01:27.417
There are actually 18 FDA-approved
methods of birth control,

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:30.670
each with different efficacy
and side effect profiles,

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.923
some of which are 20 times
more effective than others.

00:01:33.965 --> 00:01:36.217
The reason you don't know
about this is simple.

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.513
Outside of specialty family planning
clinics that are few and far between,

00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:42.724
health care organizations
don't educate people

00:01:42.724 --> 00:01:44.517
about all their birth control options

00:01:44.517 --> 00:01:46.645
and don't make them easily available.

00:01:46.686 --> 00:01:50.023
But this is what Upstream,
the nonprofit I cofounded, does.

00:01:50.815 --> 00:01:54.110
We train community health centers,
hospital practices,

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.029
primary care facilities,

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:59.407
the places where the vast majority
of people get their health care,

00:01:59.407 --> 00:02:01.451
to put patient centered needs first

00:02:01.493 --> 00:02:04.162
and provide best in class
contraceptive care

00:02:04.162 --> 00:02:06.331
as a part of basic primary health care.

00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:11.127
(Applause)

00:02:11.127 --> 00:02:12.754
You know, when I first met Sophia,

00:02:12.796 --> 00:02:15.674
I'd been listening for years
to what young people were saying

00:02:15.674 --> 00:02:18.510
about the challenges they were facing
achieving their goals.

00:02:18.551 --> 00:02:20.679
And I was struck
by how many of their stories

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:21.971
began with some version of,

00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:24.974
“Well, I found myself pregnant
and I had to drop out of school.”

00:02:24.974 --> 00:02:28.228
Or, “I got my girlfriend pregnant
and I had to quit my job.”

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.064
I just kept hearing these stories,
I wasn't looking for it.

00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:34.776
And I came away from those
conversations utterly convinced

00:02:34.818 --> 00:02:37.862
that lack of equitable access
to contraception,

00:02:37.904 --> 00:02:41.783
the inability to get the birth control
method you want, when you want it,

00:02:41.783 --> 00:02:44.035
with full information,

00:02:44.035 --> 00:02:46.913
was a critical factor
derailing the life trajectories

00:02:46.913 --> 00:02:48.790
of many young people in this country.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.794
It's obviously not the only
structural barrier they face, of course,

00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:56.923
but I really have come to believe
that it is a major cause of inequality,

00:02:56.965 --> 00:02:59.467
and it's one we can actually do
something about.

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:00.719
Back to Sophia.

00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:03.138
She told me she faced countless barriers

00:03:03.138 --> 00:03:06.474
trying to get another method
of birth control that was more effective.

00:03:07.142 --> 00:03:09.561
After hearing from a friend about the IUD,

00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:12.188
one of the most effective
methods of birth control,

00:03:12.188 --> 00:03:13.898
she decided she wanted that method.

00:03:14.774 --> 00:03:16.860
So she ended up getting
a day off from work,

00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:18.194
borrowing a car

00:03:18.236 --> 00:03:21.322
and driving the three hours
to her health center to get one.

00:03:21.322 --> 00:03:22.615
But when she got there,

00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:24.868
they told her that they had
to order one for her

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.662
and the sole provider they had
who could place that method

00:03:27.662 --> 00:03:29.539
was only available on Tuesdays.

00:03:30.498 --> 00:03:32.584
They told her to come back
two weeks later.

00:03:33.418 --> 00:03:35.378
Even holding down two jobs,

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.381
she managed to borrow that car
and make that three-hour journey

00:03:38.423 --> 00:03:39.591
and get the day off,

00:03:39.591 --> 00:03:42.677
but was told once again
they couldn't place it that day.

00:03:42.677 --> 00:03:44.679
They told her to come back a third time,

00:03:44.721 --> 00:03:46.848
but this time, she couldn't
get the time off.

00:03:47.223 --> 00:03:49.225
Five months later, she did come back,

00:03:49.225 --> 00:03:51.561
this time unintentionally pregnant.

00:03:53.396 --> 00:03:55.815
Sophia's story demonstrates
how unplanned pregnancy

00:03:55.815 --> 00:03:59.110
is rooted in inequitable access
to birth control.

00:03:59.694 --> 00:04:01.529
Sophia didn't know that many providers

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.157
aren't trained to offer
contraception beyond the pill.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.202
Many health centers don't even stock
the full range of methods,

00:04:07.202 --> 00:04:09.287
so it can take multiple
visits and referrals

00:04:09.287 --> 00:04:12.248
to get one of the more effective
methods of birth control.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.252
Sophia didn't have the privilege
of that kind of time for birth control,

00:04:16.252 --> 00:04:19.005
so she ended up settling
for the only option she had.

00:04:20.673 --> 00:04:22.801
Now instead of that experience,

00:04:22.842 --> 00:04:27.514
imagine a regular doctor's visit
in primary care like this.

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.184
First, no matter why a patient
comes in for care,

00:04:31.184 --> 00:04:35.063
they're asked a deceptively simple,
standard screening question.

00:04:35.522 --> 00:04:38.024
"Do you plan to become pregnant
in the next year?"

00:04:39.275 --> 00:04:41.778
The answer to that question
opens up a whole dialogue

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.030
about what they care about
and what they want.

00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:46.533
Second, if the answer is no,

00:04:46.574 --> 00:04:50.161
patients should be offered the full range
of contraceptive methods

00:04:50.203 --> 00:04:51.663
with full information,

00:04:51.704 --> 00:04:54.707
so they can really choose the method
that works best for them.

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:56.000
And most importantly,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.877
they should be able to leave that visit

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.088
with the birth control method
of their choice,

00:05:00.088 --> 00:05:02.465
not be asked to come back
two or three more times.

00:05:02.507 --> 00:05:07.303
This is really about shifting the system
of primary care to empower patients.

00:05:08.054 --> 00:05:11.140
Well, you don't have to imagine it,
we actually did this.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.726
We trained up the entire
health care system in Delaware

00:05:13.768 --> 00:05:14.936
to work this way.

00:05:14.978 --> 00:05:18.273
We worked there because patient surveys
showed, when we started,

00:05:18.273 --> 00:05:21.276
that more than half
of all pregnancies were unplanned.

00:05:21.317 --> 00:05:22.902
Three years later,

00:05:22.902 --> 00:05:25.321
the percentage of births
from unplanned pregnancies

00:05:25.321 --> 00:05:26.823
dropped 23 percent.

00:05:26.823 --> 00:05:28.992
The abortion rate dropped 37 percent,

00:05:28.992 --> 00:05:32.078
the largest decline
of any state in the country.

00:05:32.078 --> 00:05:35.665
And within six years,
infant mortality dropped 24 percent.

00:05:35.832 --> 00:05:42.797
(Cheers and applause)

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:47.010
Upstream is now working in 14 states
with plans to go national.

00:05:48.094 --> 00:05:51.639
(Cheers and applause)

00:05:51.681 --> 00:05:55.518
It is unconscionable,
unconscionable, that Sophia,

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.395
and millions like her in this country,

00:05:57.395 --> 00:05:59.689
don't have access
to birth control like this.

00:05:59.731 --> 00:06:01.983
Especially in a post-Roe world.

00:06:01.983 --> 00:06:04.235
I think we can all agree

00:06:04.277 --> 00:06:07.238
that ensuring people have access
to the birth control they need

00:06:07.238 --> 00:06:08.823
so they can plan their families

00:06:08.823 --> 00:06:10.867
or decide if they want to have one or not,

00:06:10.867 --> 00:06:13.786
isn't a blue, red or a purple-state idea.

00:06:13.828 --> 00:06:17.749
It's a smart, just, empowering
idea for everyone.

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:21.294
If we care about giving young people
the best start at their dreams,

00:06:21.294 --> 00:06:25.757
let's make sure they have access
to fully equitable, fully informed,

00:06:25.757 --> 00:06:29.844
patient-centered contraceptive care
as a part of basic primary health care.

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:35.224
We can empower patients like Sophia
with the choices and tools they need

00:06:35.266 --> 00:06:37.977
to become the intentional
parents they want to be.

00:06:38.311 --> 00:06:40.313
Access to best-in-class health care

00:06:40.313 --> 00:06:43.691
and best-in-class contraceptive care
is a health equity issue,

00:06:43.733 --> 00:06:45.568
but it is so much more than that.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.321
It's also a foundation
of equal opportunity.

00:06:48.363 --> 00:06:49.530
Thank you.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:54.410
(Cheers and applause)
